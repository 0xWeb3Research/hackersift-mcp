# Findings
## High Risk

### [MNTF4-1] Insufficient verification of staking account in Unstake struct

**Severity:** High

**Description:** The `unstake()` instruction facilitates the withdrawal of staked funds for a user. Within the `unstake.rs` instruction implementation, the call to `unstake_handler()` updates the staked amount by deducting `amount` from `staking.tokens_staked` at line 115. This ensures that the `user` account staked balance is reduced accordingly.  The issue arise when the `Unstake` struct does not validate that the `staking` account is derived from `ctx.user`'s public key using specific seeds. 

This is because the staking account's seeds are only explicitly validated when the account is initialized via the `initialize_claim_handler` instruction, and not within its struct definition in the `staking.rs` state implementation.

As a result, an attacker can pass an arbitrary `staking` PDA belonging to another user. This allows them to deduct funds from another user's staking account and subsequently claim tokens from `mint_controller_token_account` into their own wallet. 

This issue does not affect other PDAs such as `global` and `claim_controller`, as the static seeds for these accounts are implicitly validated in their state structs, and these accounts cannot be re-initialized after their respective initialization handler instructions have been called due to the `init` macro being used.

Note that the off-chain signing API could not be verified for mitigations against this issue. However due to the fact that the passed `staking` account would be a valid PDA for the program, additional mitigations are recommended at the program level.


**Remediation:**  Consider re-validating the `staking` PDA seeds before it is passed to the `unstake_handler` instruction.

Ensure that all implemented modifications to account derivation, and the implications this may have for off-chain systems, are thoroughly tested. 

**Status:**  Fixed

## Medium Risk

### [MNTF4-6] Users may unstake using staking accounts derived using a different season ID

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:** Similar in nature to MNTF4-1, it is possible for a userâ€™s previously derived staking PDA, derived from a seed which includes a particular seasonID, to be used when unstaking from an unrelated season. Consider the following scenario:

- `User stakes with stake(seasonID: 1, amount: 1, nonce(pubkey, seasonID:1))`, creating a valid PDA#1 from the seeds `user.key()`,`"staking"`, and `seasonID = 1`.

- User stakes again with `stake(seasonID: 2, amount: 100, nonce(pubkey, seasonID:2))`, again causing a valid staking PDA#2 to be derived using the seeds `user.key()`,`"staking"`, and `seasonID = 2`.

- User may then unstake with `unstake(seasonID: 1, amount: 100, nonce(pubkey, seasonID:1))`, but supplying PDA#2. 

    - This will also cause an event to be emitted which broadcasts that the user has unstaked an amount exceeding their stake for season 1.

The root causes of this are:

- The same user ATA account `user_token_account` is used to hold all staked funds for all seasons.

- There is no current means to differentiate between staking PDAs derived using different `seasonIDs` when unstaking. While staking account nonces are being validated, they are not being validated against any expected season IDs, so a nonce derived from a previous season ID may be used together with a staking PDA from a different season ID.

This may allow users to game season rewards, by using funds staked as part of one season to gain rewards as part of another season. This may result in considerable losses if the staking requirements for the staked season are lower/significantly different from the season being unstaked from.

Without further mitigations, this may still be possible after remediating MNTF4-1, as both staking PDAs would share the same `user.key()` seed. 

**Remediation:**  Consider validating the `staking` PDA seeds before it is used by the `unstake_handler` instruction.

Depending on the structure of Mintify seasons, additionally consider using separate per-season user token ATA accounts in subsequent releases of the program, to ensure funds are properly segregated between seasons if necessary. Ensure that these changes are thoroughly reviewed for security issues and compatibility with Mintify season tokenomics. 

**Status:**  Fixed

### [MNTF4-2] Direct theft of funds via claiming, should off-chain services fail

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:** The `claim_handler` instruction takes `amount` and `owed` as parameters. Since the token amount is validated using `owed`, without sufficient validation from the off-chain signing API, it would be possible to specify arbitrary amounts, allowing for the withdrawal of all tokens.

It is understood that the off-chain signing API validates all incoming orders against expected token lock periods and amounts, before signing transactions which may then be co-signed and executed by users. This finding is therefore raised primarily for awareness, but with elevated severity due to the potential risk inherent to the design.

**Remediation:**  Ensure that all relevant off-chain services, particularly those responsible for singing transactions and validating on-chain states, are thoroughly reviewed prior to deployment, with a secondary focus on any modifications to the on-chain program and how they may affect the overall system.

As a defense in depth measure, consider adding additional on-chain verification of token amounts to subsequent releases of the program. 

Additionally, ensure best web application/API security practices are adhered to with respect to the signing API, as the API would be considered a high-value target for sophisticated threat actors. In particular, ensure a robust access control and key management systems are applied to the signing API, even if the API is not intended to be exposed publicly.

### [MNTF4-3] Project cannot compile due to missing semicolon

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:** On line 3 of the file `src/instructions/claim.rs`, the semicolon at the end of the import statement is missing. This will prevent the project from compiling.

**Remediation:**  Add a semicolon at the end of the affected line.

**Status:**  Fixed

## Low Risk

### [MNTF4-7] Unstake event emissions may contain invalid season IDs

**Severity:** Low

**Description:** The `unstake_handler` instruction allows any value for `season_id` to be used, which is eventually emitted in the `Unstaked` event without prior validation. This `season_id` value does not need to be a valid season ID previously used to derive a `staking` account, and can be any `u64` value. Therefore it is possible to broadcast events with invalid/incorrect season IDs for otherwise valid unstake operations. 

**Remediation:**  Validate that the `season_id` argument can be used to derive the expected corresponding staking account and nonce, ensuring that only valid season IDs for a particular staking account can be used in the same unstake instruction. 

As the on-chain program does not currently keep a record of season IDs, this likely needs to be implemented by off-chain validation services. Ensure season ID validation is thoroughly reviewed prior to deployment.

### [MNTF4-9] Incorrect LEN parameter in Staking and ClaimState

**Severity:** Low

**Description:** The `Staking` and `ClaimState` state structs contain two `u64` values and one `u64` respectively. According to Anchor documentation, the correct account data size should be 16 and 8 bytes accordingly (plus 8 bytes for Anchor's internal discriminator). Currently however, both structures contain an unidentified  + 1, effectively occupying 17 and 9 bytes.

References:
[Anchor documentation regarding account space per datatype](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/references/space#type-chart)

**Remediation:**  Consider removing the `+ 1` from both `LEN` constants if this extra byte is not necessary.

**Status:** Fixed
