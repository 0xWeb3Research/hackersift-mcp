# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Use SafeERC20

**Description**

BaseLiquidityPool.sol
FlashHedge.sol
PerpetualMarket.sol
ERC20 tokens should be transferred with ‘safeTransfer’ and ‘safeTransferFrom’. SafeERC20
performs all the checks that tokens were transferred, including ono-standard ERC20
implementation(like in USDT tokens).

**Recommendation**:

Use ‘safeTransfer’ and ‘safeTransferFrom’ instead.

### No checks for overflow/underflow.

**Description**

Math.sol, functions addDelta(), scale(), logTaylor(), logTaylor1()
Arithmetical operations should be checked in order not to overflow or underflow.

**Recommendation**:

Use SafeMath library or update Solidity version to 0.8.x, since starting with this version,
Solidity has built-in asserts for overflow/underflow.

### Unsafe type cast.

**Description**

PerpetualMarket.sol, function deposit(), line 110.
Such unsafe cast can also lead to incorrect shares calculation,, since user can pass a value
greater than uint128,
shares would be minted with this value, but the actual transferred amount would be lower.

**Recommendation**:

Use SafeCast.

## Informational

### Check constructor parameters.

**Description**

FlashHegde.sol: constructor().
All address parameters should be verified in order not to be zero address.

**Recommendation**:

Add ‘require’ statements to check that address parameters are not zero addresses.
