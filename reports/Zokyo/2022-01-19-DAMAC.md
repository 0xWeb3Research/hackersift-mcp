# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Presale round does not return ETH

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, presaleMint()
presaleMint() function does not return excess ETH amount like the mint() function does. Thus
ETH may be left stuck on the contract.

**Recommendation**:

Verify the presaleMint() should not return excess ETH or correct the behaviour.

### Shadow naming

**Description**


CryptoBearWathcClub.sol, walletOfOwner()
Parameter “_owner” shadows storage variable.

**Recommendation**:

Consider renaming.

## Informational

### Meaningless override

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)
Function has the same code as the parent ERC721 contract, thus its override is meaningless. It
is enough to override the safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes).

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary override.

**Post-audit**:

Verified after the conversation with the team.

### Solidity version should be updated

**Description**


Best practices for Solidity development and auditors standard checklist requires strict and
explicit usage of the latest stable version of Solidity, which is 0.8.11 at the moment.

**Recommendation**:

Consider updating to “pragma solidity 0.8.11;”.

### Variables can be changed to constants

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol:
priceDeductionPercentage, startingPrice
Variables can be changed to public constants, since they are not changed throughout the
code.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of the public constants.
