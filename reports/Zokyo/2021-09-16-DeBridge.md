# Findings

## High Risk

### An attacker, could make a malicious smart contract that is going to borrow money from the flash loan function, and in the flashCallback function that he implements, he could call the send function from the DeBridgeGate contract, adding the balance back in the contract but also emitting a Send event, that will be captured by the validators and tokens will be minted on the other chains. After that, he can burn the tokens from the other chains to retrieve them back in the original chain and stole all the liquidity.

**Recommendation**:

You can prevent this attack by adding the nonReentrant modifier on the send function, so
when the flashCallback function will call the send function it will revert because it already was
previously in the flash function.

## Low Risk

### Duplicating code leaves the codebase prone to the introduction of errors. Errors can inadvertently be introduced when functionality changes are not replicated across all instances of code that should be identical. Logic and storage duplication between ConfirmationAggregator and SignatureVerifier, the logic in deployAsset function is duplicated and also the storage slots of getDeployInfo are duplicated on ConfirmationAggregator, SignatureAggregator, and SignatureVerifier, this can run on synchronization problems between storages.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a common module to store the data and inherit that module by the other
contracts, and also a common module for the duplicated logic should be added.

### Many of the event definitions are lacking indexed parameters. Some examples including, all events in IAggregatorBase, all events in IConfirmationAggregator, all events in IDeBridgeGate, all events in ISignatureAggregator, all events in DelegateStaking.

**Recommendation**:

Index the parameters, as another best practice recommendation is that both the new value
set and the old value set should be added in the event.

### Lack of input validation in functions updateChainSupport, updateAssetFixedFees, updateExcessConfirmations, setChainSupport, setCallProxy, setAggregator, setSignatureVerifier, setDefiController, setFeeProxy, setWeth, updateFlashFee, updateCollectRewardBps, updateFeeDiscount, updateTreasury from DeBridgeGate contract, these are all functions that take input from “trusted” parties, but those inputs must be checked too because “trusted” parties can make mistakes too, for example, you should check if the value you want to send is equal with the value that is already stored, to prevent unnecessary gas used, if a require would detect that the values are the same, then the gas used would be reverted, or to check if an address or uint256 is equal to 0.

**Recommendation**:

Add input validation to do sanity checks.

## Informational

### Specifying a pragma version with the caret symbol (^) upfront which tells the compiler to use any version of solidity bigger than specified considered not a good practice. Since there could be major changes between versions that would make your code unstable. The latest known versions with bugs are 0.8.3 and 0.8.4.

**Recommendation**:

Set the latest version without the caret. (The latest version that is also known as bug-free is
0.8.7).

### In the DeBridgeGate contract, Initialize function, the ChainSupportInfo data is provided, later in the internal _send function, the contract is using that data, for example, the fixedNativeFee field, if that field has the value zero, the execution it is stopped because of the next require line (line 864), because there is no sanitization on the initialization in the Initialize function.

**Recommendation**:

Put some sanitization requirements in the Initialize function for the data structures. We know
that function can only be called by the team, but mistakes can be made internally too, that’s
why this is classified just as informational and not as a medium problem.

### In the DeBridgeGate contract, Initialize function, it would be useful to add in the for loop condition an OR (“ || “) logical operator to check for the gas left, this way if the _supportedChainIds array is too large, the execution will not stop with “out of gas” and block it.
