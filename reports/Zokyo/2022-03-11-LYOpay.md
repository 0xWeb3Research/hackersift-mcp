# Findings

## High Risk

### Owner is not initialized

**Description**

LYO.sol, initializer()
Owner is not initialized. The issue is marked as high and not critical, because owner is used for
funds recovering only.

**Recommendation**:

Add owner initialization.

## Medium Risk

### SafeERC20 usage preferable

TokenRecover, recoverERC20()

**Description**

Consider usage of SafeTransfer library, because unsafe token transfer will revert with the non-
standard implementation of the ERC20 standard (like for example USDT has).

**Recommendation**:

Use SafeERC20 library.

## Low Risk

### Ownable and AccessControl mixed

**Description**

LYO.sol utilizes both ownership and access control with roles, which is over-complification of
the contract, as owner can be set up as a separate role or the admin itself.

**Recommendation**:

Omit Ownable functionality and use AccessControl only.

### Extra check

**Description**

LYO.sol, renounceRole() contains extra check, since 2 of 3 existing “require” statements are
enough to cover all cases.

**Recommendation**:

Remove extra check.

## Informational

### Upgradable token

**Description**

LYO.sol
The token is implemented as upgradable, thus the owner of the token (deployer) has full
control over the contract. Thus, this fact should be reflected in the audit report.

**Recommendation**:

Provide a non-upgradable token or provide the guarantees for the users against the contract
modification.
