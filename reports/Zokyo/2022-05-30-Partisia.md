# Findings

## Low Risk

### Locked by the max value.

**Description**

WithdrawAndDeposit.sol: update().
Parameter “newLargeOracleNonce” is not validated from above. Thus there can be a situation
when the oracles passes the max value (or value far after the current largeOracleNonce) in
order to block the work of the update() function and prevent the change of the oracles set.
The issue is set as Low, because the oracle is set during the initialization, thus must be
trusted. By due the reason, that it is not validated in any way, the issue should be present in
the report.

**Recommendation**:

Validate the“newLargeOracleNonce” from above or add the validation to the oracle or verify
that oracle will be trusted.

## Informational

### Variables lack validation.

**Description**

WithdrawAndDeposit.sol: initialize().
Parameters “_depositMinimum” and “_depositMaximum” should be validated, so that
“_depositMaximum” is greater than “_depositMinimum”. In case, condition is not met, the
protocol won’t be able to operate. Issue is marked as info, since initialize() is called during
deployment and the deployer should verify passed parameters manually.

**Recommendation**:

Validate that “_depositMaximum” is greater than “_depositMinimum”.
