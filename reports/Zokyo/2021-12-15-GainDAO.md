# Findings

## High Risk

### More logic required

**Description**

The logic for KYC is missing and it is very vital to the operation of the contract. To be more
specific the purchaseAllowed function doesnâ€™t have the required logic needed to perform KYC.

**Recommendation**:

Include the KYC logic as planned.

## Informational

### Logic could be improved

**Description**

Some logic in the contract can be improved to make it more logical and more readable. An
example of this is the required statements starting on lines 50 and 55 respectively.
The statement require(distStartRate > 0 && distEndRate > 0, "TokenDistribution: rates should >
0") starting on line 55 should come before the statement require(distStartRate > distEndRate,
"TokenDistribution: start rate should be > end rate") starting on line 50. As it is more logical and
more readable to confirm the rates are greater than zero first before comparing the rates

**Recommendation**:

Interchange the specified lines. That is the required statement confirming the rates are
greater than zero should come first and the required statement comparing the distStartRate
and distEndRate should come later.

### Unnecessary Function

**Description**

The function beneficiary() on line 76 is unnecessary as the public variables (_beneficiary is a
public variable) come with a getter function by default and there is no need to include a getter
function for them.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the function and use the default function _beneficiary to get the value anytime it is
needed.

### Redundant logic

**Description**

The logic on line 112 require(paused(), 'Distribution already started') is not needed as the
WhenPaused modifier is used on the function and so the function would only run when the
contract is paused.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the specified statement as it serves no purpose.

### Redundant logic

**Description**

The logic on line 69: _kyc_approver = address(0) is not needed as the default value for variables
of type address is address(0).

**Recommendation**:

Remove the specified statement as it serves no purpose.

### Logic can be improved

**Description**

The logic in the purchaseToken can be slightly improved in order to make it more readable.
The require statement on Line 197: require(actualrate>0, "unable to sell at the given rate:
distribution has ended") should come before the statement at line 192:
require(rate==actualrate, "unable to sell at the given rate: the rate has changed") as it is more
logical and reads better to confirm the actual rate is greater than zero first before comparing
the equality of the rates.

**Recommendation**:

Move the require statement on line 192 (the one that compares the two rates) to line 197 and
then move the require statement that confirms the actual rate is greater than zero to line 192.
