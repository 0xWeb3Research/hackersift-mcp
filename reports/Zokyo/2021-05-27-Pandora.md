# Findings

## High Risk

### Not standard ERC20

**Description**

For now the protocol uses a modified version of ERC20. The contract is obtained from the
OpenZeppelin library and contains its comments, though it is modified, has no key fields
(which are moved to the token) and constructor. In general it is a bad practice to modify
standard contracts, because the logic can be lost in further development or modified
incorrectly. Good practice is to inherit the complete logic from ERC20 and provide
modification in child methods.

**Recommendation**:

Restore standard ERC20 contract, move name, symbol and decimals fields back to the original
contract and use constructor in order to set those values.

## Medium Risk

### Solidity version update

**Description**

The solidity version should be updated. Throughout the project (including interfaces).
Issue is classified as Medium, because it is included to the list of standard smart contracts’
vulnerabilities. Currently used version (0.5.17) is considered obsolete, which contradicts the
standard checklist.

**Recommendation**:

You need to update the solidity version to the latest one in the branch - consider 0.6.12 or
0.7.6 or 0.8.4

## Low Risk

### Move decimals to the variable


**Description**

Move the expression “10 ** uint256(decimals)” to the totalTokensAmount variable in order to
minimize in-code calculations and increase the code style. Also, since decimals are set just
once and there is no interface to change it, the number can be used instead of decimals
variable.

**Recommendation**:

Move decimals multiplier to the variable and use number instead of the variable.

### Use constant value

**Description**

totalTokensAmount can be set as constant. It will perform gas optimization and increase the
code style.

**Recommendation**:

Set totalTokensAmount as constant.
