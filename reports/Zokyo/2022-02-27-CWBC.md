# Findings

## High Risk

### Smart contract owner has ability to define addresses that are able to burn anyone's tokens.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, setAllowedAddresses & burn
**Recommendation**:
Whitelisted or anyone should be able to burn only their own tokens.

### User can claim rewards before the start.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, claimReward()
rewardGenerationStartTime is not checked against 0, thus the condition in function is always
true, and the user gets the ability to claim tokens before rewards start. Especially because
rewardGenerationStartTime is set independently from main functionality.
**Recommendation**:
Review the functionality and add necessary conditions.

### Staking is not used to calculate Arkouda tokens to be rewarded for owners, but number of days held.

**Recommendation**:
Add Staking Smart contract to repo and reimplement logic of Arkouda tokens minting.

### Value of BASE_REWARD state variable is incorrect.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, BASE_REWARD
BASE_REWARD equals 10 Arkouda tokens, but according to requirements the minimum tier
equals 3ARK/day (0.00208333/second).

**Recommendation**:
Apply the correct value to BASE_REWARD.

### Smart contract owner is able to disable claiming of Arkouda token rewards.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, flipArkoudaClaimStatus

**Recommendation**:

Add restrictions when Arkouda tokens reward claiming should be stopped.

### Smart contract owner is able to change state variable rewardGenerationStartTime of Smart contract Arkouda to a newer date that will influence holders of CryptoBearWatchClub NFT and their claimable reward amounts.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, startRewardGeneration
**Recommendation**:
Add check that the state variable startRewardGeneration was not initialized before storing a
new value to it.

### Smart contract owner is able to set any reward amount for holding of

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub NFT in the Smart contract Arkouda. (Resolved)
Arkouda.sol, setTokenIdReward

**Recommendation**:
Predefine reward amounts per NFT tier or let community to vote on changing reward
amounts.

### Rewards calculation is done by counting number of days since last transfer instead of counting number of seconds since last transfer.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, getPendingReward

**Recommendation**:

Change calculation to be seconds based instead of days.

### Smart contract owner is able to override CryptoBearWatchClub NFT reward amounts in the Smart contract Arkouda after their purchase.

**Description**

Arkouda.sol, setTokenIdReward

**Recommendation**:

Define rewards for NFT based on their tier level during purchase and revoke Smart contract
owner from changing it.

**Note**.

CBWC team provided list of purchased NFTs and their tiers. We verified that tier levels were
correctly applied to Arkouda contract as of Transaction.

## Medium Risk

### Methods accepting empty array as input arguments.

**Description**


Arkouda.sol, stakeCBWC, unStakeCBWC, claimRewards

**Recommendation**:

Add check that the array of token ids has length more than zero.

### SRP (Single-responsibility principle) . Smart contract Arkouda contains token & NFT staking logic.

**Recommendation**:
It is good practice to isolate token & staking logic.

### DRY. Rewards calculation logic is placed in both methods claimReward and getTotalClaimable.
Arkouda.sol, claimReward and getTotalClaimable

**Recommendation**:
Consider to invoke method getTotalClaimable inside of claimReward to reuse existent logic
and decrease final byte code.

## Informational

### Set proper name of method setCbwcNftTier.

Arkouda.sol, setCbwcNftTier

**Recommendation**:
Cover all public methods with Natspec annotations.

### Public methods are partially covered with Natspec annotations.

**Recommendation**:
Rename method to setNFTTier or setCBWCNFTTier.

### Repository does not contain dependency management of Smart contracts.
**Recommendation**:
initialize NPM repository and define dependency to Openzeppelin smart contracts package.

### Repository does not contain Ethereum development environment configuration.

**Recommendation**:
use Truffle or Hardhat toolkits for automating of running tests, deployments and migrations.

### Solidity version should be updated.

**Description**

Best practices for Solidity development and auditors standard checklist requires strict and
explicit usage of the latest stable version of Solidity, which is 0.8.11 at the moment.

**Recommendation**:
Consider updating to “pragma solidity 0.8.11;”.
