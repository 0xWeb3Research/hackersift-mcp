# Findings


## High Risk

### Incorrect initialization

**Description**

PontoonTokenVesting.sol, line 113, 126, 151, 154, 157, constructor()
Incorrect parameters are passed to the _addTeam() for Ecosystem and for Community -
vesting time and N of vestings are at the wrong places.
The same is applicable for all _addRound() calls.

**Recommendation**:

Correct the order of the parameters and verify the initialization.
Post-audit: marked as resolved after the conversation with Pontoon team and verification.

## Medium Risk

### Incorrect documentation (or parameter)

**Description**

PontoonTokenVesting.sol, line 126, 156, constructor()
The documentation comment states for 35.5% of supply for the Community rewards. Though,
35% is passed to _addTeam() function.
Potentially either incorrect comment (which is more likely) or incorrect parameter.
The same for the Strategic round - 15% stated in the comment, 4% passed to the method.

**Recommendation**: 

Verify the functionality and correct the comment or the documentation.
Post-audit: The functionality is verified, though comment is still incorrect.

## Low Risk

### Gas optimization with SafeMath omitting

**Description**


Solidity 0.8.4 has integrated support of safe arithmetical operations with overflow and
underflow handling. So in such case SafeMath library can be omitted in order to perform gas
savings.

**Recommendation**:

SafeMath library can be omitted.

### Method should emit event

**Description**

PontoonToken.sol, setGovernance()
It is recommended to emit events for the governance (or any other access control value)
change.

**Recommendation**:

Emit event for the governance change.

## Informational

### Move “Magic numbers” to constants

**Description**

PontoonTokenVesting.sol, line 116, 117, 120, 129, 130, 133, 142, 151, 154, 159, 161, 169, 321,
355, 449, 470
A lot of contract’s central constants are kept as “magic numbers”. For example:
- the accuracy (10000)
- the percent per team and per round, vesting time (constructor)
- the number of rounds (_massUpdateCliffEndTime())
Consider usage of named constants or variables to keep those values. This will increase the
readability of the code and will help with further development.

**Recommendation**:

Use constants instead of “magic” numbers.
