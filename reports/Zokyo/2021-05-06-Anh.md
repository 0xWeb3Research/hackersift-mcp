# Findings

## High Risk

### CrossPool utilizes shared time lock & end investment block

**Description**

CrossPool v1 specification points that “Each pool will have an end block; i.e. the last block
a reward will be distributed.”, but instead of that all pools are using end investment block &
time lock params defined during CrossPool deployment.

## Method massUpdatePools from CrossPool contract is vulnerable to `Out of gas`

**Description**

Method massUpdatePools from CrossPool contract is iterating over all registered pools, and if
the number of pools exceeds a specific number, then it will fail execution. It also affects the
addition of new pools by using the method `add` and passing arguments withUpdate equal
to true, when the list of pools already added is a greater specific number.

**Snippet**:
```solidity
uint256 length = poolInfo.length;
for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < length; ++pid) {
updatePool(pid);
}
```
## CrossPool staker can get fewer reward tokens in case if RewardVault has less balance than accumulated reward tokens

**Description**

RewardVault is not returning the actual amount of tokens transferred to Stacker and
CrossPool contract marks that all reward tokens transferred.

**Snippet 1**:
```solidity
if(block.number >= timeLock && totalPending > 0) {
user.accClaim = 0;
rewardVault.safeRewardTransfer(msg.sender, totalPending);
}
```
**Snippet 2**:
```solidity
function safeRewardTransfer(
address to,
uint256 amount
) public onlyOwner {
uint256 rewardTokenBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 transferableAmount = amount > rewardTokenBalance
? rewardTokenBalance
: amount;
rewardToken.safeTransfer(to, transferableAmount);
}
```

## Low Risk

### Method initialize from CrossPool contract utilizes misleading names for arguments blockDuration & timeLockDuration

**Description**
Arguments blockDuration & timeLockDuration are used as a number of blocks instead of
commonly used to represent a number of seconds.

**Snippet**:
```solidity
startBlock = startBlock_;
endBlock = startBlock_.add(blockDuration);
timeLock = startBlock_.add(timeLockDuration);
```
## Informational

### RewardVault ownership has to be manually transferred to deployed CrossPool contract

**Description**

RewardVault contract ownership after deployment has to be manually or over automation,
script be transferred to deployed CrossPool contract. Until that CrossPool contract is not
operational.

### RewardVault utilizes Proxy pattern and can be upgraded anytime after transferring ownership to CrossPool contract

**Description**
RewardVault is deployed utilizing the TransparentProxy pattern that utilizes ProxyAdmin
contract address that is controlled by the initial contract deployer.
