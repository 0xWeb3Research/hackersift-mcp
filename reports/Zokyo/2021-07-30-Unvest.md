# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Multiple use of redeemToken.transferFrom() function without verification of successful, contract have no control over the redeemToken implementation, it just knows it is implementing an interface of type IERC20, if the underlying ERC20 contract is not implementing allowance properly or other cases, the execution on erc20 may be unsuccessful but the next function from Unvest contracts will be executed: e.g. mint function.

**Recommendation**:

Wrap all transfer and transferFrom function calls in the unvest contract in a require().

### Multiple use of block.timestamp, block.timestamp can be manipulated by miners with up to900ms.

**Recommendation**:

Use block.number instead of block.timestamp and calculate time based on mined blocks, 1
block is mined every 15 secs so 1 minute = 4 blocks and so on...

**Partner response for this issue**:

Because we aren t using short time durations for vesting it s safe to compare with
block.timestamp in our case.

## Low Risk

### Smart contracts are not completely covered by NatSpec annotations:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.4/style guide.html

### Function addRecipients from LiquidVestingToken could be optimized, if the length of the recipients array is to large, the function will revert with out of gas.

**Recommendation**:

Make the operations O(1).

### Function createLiquidVestingToken from LiquidVestingTokenFactory could be optimized, if the length of the name array is to large, the function will revert with out of gas.

**Recommendation**:

Make the operations O(1).

**Partner response for this issue**:

It is better to use O(n) operations instead of O(1). This ensures the correct minting vesting
tokens for users, owner can add the same users once again. Also with operations O(1) we
need loops to check the amount and address from the arrays that are stored in the contract,
which can lead to out of gas.

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract you can set merkleRootSigner via constructor or with function setMerkleRootSigner() in both cases there is no check for setting it to the zero address.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for the zero address to the contract constructor and function setMerkleRootSigner().

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract you can set feeCollector via constructor or with function setFeeCollector() in both cases there is no check for setting it to the zero address.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for the zero address to the contract constructor and function setFeeCollector().

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract you can set fee via constructor or with function setFee(). In function setFee() you have additional checks that fee would not be beyond rank of constant values MIN_FEE and MAX_FEE and those checks are missing in constructor.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for fee value to the contract constructor.

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract in function createLiquidVestingToken you can set for Liquid Vesting Token any time for the activationTimestamp and redeemTimestamp. So redeemTimestamp can be before activationTimestamp, they both can be equal zero.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for the activationTimestamp and redeemTimestamp.

## Informational

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract typo in variable domainSeparatop.

**Recommendation**:

Change variable name to the domainSeparator.

### In LiquidVestingTokenFactory contract you are declaring the usage of AbiEncoderV2 with pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2, but since solidity 0.7.4 that feature is not experimental anymore,

**Recommendation**:

It can be easily replaced with pragma abicoder v2:

### Function redeem from LiquidVestingToken readability could be improved.

**Recommendation**:

Extract first require in a modifier with name onlyAfterRedeemTimestampHasPassed.

### The contracts code does not fully respect to style imposed by the community:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.4/style-guide.html

**Recommendation**:

Increase code readability by refactoring it to follow the community style standart.
