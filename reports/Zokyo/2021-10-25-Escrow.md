# Findings

## High Risk

### Compilation failed

**Description**

src/lib.rs:6
The module util does not exist.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the usage of the nonexistent module or add the module to the source code.

### Incorrect LISTING_FEE value

**Description**

At
src/processor.rs:22
It says 1000000 is 0.01 SOL
But from the docs at https://docs.solana.com/terminology#lamport
1 SOL is 1000000000 lamport, so 0.01 SOL = 10000000, one zero is missing

**Recommendation**:

Use the way how it works in Solidity. All calculations are in uint256 and replace statements like
x=x*0.25 with x=x*25/100.

## Medium Risk

### Test_init_escrow failed

**Description**

When I call the tests execution I get:
---- test_init_escrow stdout ----
thread 'test_init_escrow' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
left: `1000000`,
right: `10000000`', tests/lib.rs:896:5

**Recommendation**:

Fix tests.

### Test_process_escrow failed

**Description**

When I call the tests execution I get:
thread 'test_process_escrow' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
left: `12040255`,
right: `12040230`', tests/lib.rs:1250:5

**Recommendation**:

Fix tests.

### Invalid floats comparison

**Description**


At:
src/processor.rs:72
There is a statement
ui_amount != 1.0
There are two problems here.
First, you need to explicitly use 1.0f64.
Second, strict comparison for float numbers is not safe, check https://floating-point-gui.de/
errors/comparison/

**Recommendation**:

Use (ui_amount - 1.0f64).abs() > error_margin

### Using floats for financial calculations is dangerous


**Description**

There are a lot of calculations with floats.
It is dangerous practice for financial applications because of the way how floats are
implemented. They have unpredictable “small” error, which may give some magick like a-b+b !
= a
Also multiplications to some float may be replaced with multiplication by numerator and
division by denominator for:
src/processor.rs:21
src/processor.rs:217
src/processor.rs:242
Also here you have just a weird code with no guarantees of successful comparison - src/
processor.rs:201
Also at:
src/processor.rs:263
If you use u64 you may be relaxed about negative values.

**Recommendation**:

use the way how it works in Solidity. All calculations are in uint256 and replace statements like
x=x*0.25 with x=x*25/100.

### Ensure no reentry

**Description**

To make sure, there is no possible reentrancy attacks. It’s recommended to add something
like nonReentrant lock in every external method (as in solidity).

**Recommendation**:

Use nonReentrant lock.
Post-audit: after the converstaion with the client the functionality was verified and issue
marked as Verified.

## Low Risk

### Lack of comments makes code difficult to read

**Description**

There are a lot of logic but almost no comments nor docstrings. It’s easy to misunderstand the
whole flow idea.

**Recommendation**:

Add comprehensive docstring and comments.

### Unclear structure

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:290
The purpose of such a complex structure is not clear.

**Recommendation**:

Discuss.

### Deflationary spl_token support

**Description**

To be strict, there is no guarantee that in the result of transfer of spl_token the actual transfer
of specified amount will happen. There are a lot of contracts in solidity which burn some part
of transfer amount on every call. There were some hacks related to the usage of such tokens.

**Recommendation**:

Explicitly specify, is your code support deflationary tokens or not.

### Huge functions make code less readable

**Description**

There are a lot of functions with more than 200 lines. It’s extremely difficult to understand the
whole execution flow. Especially taking into account lack of comments.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor code, use composition of smaller functions.

### No restriction on spl_token decimals

**Description**

Potentially, too big decimals may make work with such token is impossible, e.g. 1token with
decimals=20 is out of u64.

**Recommendation**:

Check the correct decimals on the contract initialization.

### Decimals=0 for spl_token in tests

**Description**

At:
tests/utils.rs:39
You test only spl_token with decimals=0, what could miss some problems with rounding in the
logic of the smart contract.

**Recommendation**:

Run tests over spl_tokens with various decimals.

### Dangerous unwrap usage

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:214
unwrap gets result or panic.

**Recommendation**:

Use error processing instead of unwrap.

## Informational

### Different impl member order from the trait

**Description**

At:
src/state.rs:28
Static analyzer gives: “Different impl member order from the trait”

**Recommendation**:

Reorder methods.

### Use self-explainable names

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:47
It’s not clear which “amount” is meant. What is the purpose of the amount??

**Recommendation**:

Rename.

### Use struct or static length array instead of iteration

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:52
src/processor.rs:136
There is a parsing over multiple values.

**Recommendation**:

It’s much safer and readable to use structs or static length arrays.

### Use syntax sugar

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:213
You can replace two statements with `if let res` to make the is_ok check, unwrap and set it to
the variable at once.
Also at:
src/processor.rs:253
You can rewrite it with `else if let ...`
Also at:
src/processor.rs:236
You may use https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.enumerate

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Check the correctness of settings at the moment when you set it. Not when you use

**Description**

it
At:
src/processor.rs:218
You check that settings are correct. But you may check it at the moment when you set them.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Expensive clone() calls

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:96
src/processor.rs:120
src/processor.rs:208
src/processor.rs:246
... everywhere in invoke ...
Also here
src/processor.rs:150
You clone structures, but it’s expensive operation and they are not likely to be changed inside
the call.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Not elegant type comparison

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:254
The comparison looks weird.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Follow language statements code-style

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:222
Use `!md.primary_sale_happened` instead.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Unclear check

**Description**

At:
src/processor.rs:232
It’s not clear why do you need to pass array as an argument if this array is required to be
equal md.data.creators. You can just take it from the metadata and remove the argument.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor.

### Static analyzer warnings
