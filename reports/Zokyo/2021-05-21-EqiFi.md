# Findings

## High Risk

### The init of the ownable contract is not called in the function init. It is also necessary to determine exactly who will be the granter: the sender or the owner.

### Ownable init is not called.

### After calling the function to remove the provider liquidation, only the value is removed, not the array element. Because of this, the size of the array will constantly increase, and all functions may not fit into the gas block, since they have unlimited cycles.

**Recommendation**:

use the EnumerableSet from openzeppelin. There, all functions are performed as a constant
and there is a possibility of iteration.

### If in the init function msg.sender is not equal to owner, then there will be an error in line #50, because the sender of the transaction will not have the right to add an operator.

**Recommendation**:
When deploying contracts, you need to be very careful with this point.

### The __initializeGrantor function of the GrantorRole contract is not called in the init function.

### Contracts do not compile due to incorrect init function.

### Functions 1 and 2 in contract 3 have modifier 4. It was not evident from the code that the SwapProtocol contract was made somewhere by the operator. Because of this, the swapERC20 and redeemSwap functions will not work.

**Recommendation**:
Fix this point in the code of migrations.

## Medium Risk

### Functions addOperator and removeOperator must be with modifier onlyOwner by analogy with contract Grantor.sol.

### In 42 and 49 lines we need to add an error to require.

### #54 line. The rate not multiplied by the amount, like in line #64.

### There is a possibility of overflow when subtracting on line 113.

**Recommendation**:
Use safeMath or add require, which will prevent this case from happening.

### Reason strings are needed in lines 37 and 54.

### Duplicate check on lines 169 and 227. If the grantor makes a mistake and passes the start date, which has not yet arrived, then an error will occur on line 298.

### Instead of _swapDivisor, it is better to use the same number everywhere. Usually, 10 ^ 27 is taken as 100%. This contract uses 10 ^ 18, so you can use this constant wherever there is division. Respectively move it into a separate variable.


### In the getSwapById function, you can return a structure object. To do this, you need to connect ABIEncoderV2.

### The swapType argument in many functions is not clear what it entails.

**Recommendation**:
Use enumeration with the required types.

## Low Risk

### It is better to use OwnableUpgradeable from Oppenzeppelin library.

### Best practice is to call parent function init.

### Avoid extra “if”, because the owner will always be admin

### Inconsistency with names. Msg.sender and _msgSender are both used in the contract. Besides, in some functions, the name of the isUniformGrantor argument is exactly the same as the name of the method. A good practice is to avoid such cases.

### Extra “if” is used.

### renounceOwnership is a useless function in this case.

**Recommendation**:
Remove the aforementioned function.

### It makes no sense to move the logic into a separate contract if it is used in one place.

### There is no point in onlyOwner modifier on getProviders getters since all data is in the open form in the blockchain and the user can still get it.

### Strings library is not used.

### #60 line. Useless variable. To reduce the total bytecode of the contract, you can write in 1 line. For example, _deposits [swapId] [participant] = DepositLeg (...);

There are a lot of storage reads in the redeem function.

**Recommendation**:

Move the most frequently used variables into local variables.

### Line #60. We can use the _participant variable, since we have checked above that it is equivalent.

### It is possible to use an interface rather than a complete contract. This will save bytecode.

**Recommendation**:
Use call instead of a transfer for the Ether. Since the gasLimit for the transfer is limited to a
constant number, sometimes it happens that there is not enough gas for the transfer. That is,
the Ether network has updated this number, and contracts for the old version of solidity, etc.

### Instead of the SECONDS_PER_DAY constant, you can use the built-in function '1 days'.

### In line #57 (at the end of the line) 'ok' should be avoided if it is not used. Please check that in all functions.

### Structures must start with a capital letter.

### A similar thing has already been described above. Can be done in one time to reduce bytecode.

### The swapETH function is useless in this case.

### Use block.timestamp instead of ‘now’, because ‘now’ is deprecated.

### Remove Strings library.
