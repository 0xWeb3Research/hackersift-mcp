# Findings

## Informational

### Use public constant

**Description**

In order to decrease gas usage during the deployment and construction of the contracts,
consider moving the number of tokens to the public constant.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of public constant for the number of tokens to be minted.

### Use ‘ethers’ literal

**Description**


Since the token (by default behaviour) has 18 decimals, there is no need to call inner function
for decimals, since ‘ethers’ literal can be used.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of ‘ethers’ for the number of tokens minted.
