### Rounding of rewards

**Description**

Because solidity doesn’t support operations with floating point it rounding values up or down.
For this reason user’s could lose part of their reward tokens. Amount of lost reward tokens
depends on the staked amount.

**Recommendation**:

Change the logic of calculation.
function _calcReflow(uint256 pid) internal view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
if (_poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount > 0) {
uint256 period;
uint256 lastRewardSecond = block.timestamp;
if (lastRewardSecond <= _poolInfo[pid].rewardEndTime) {

period = lastRewardSecond - _poolInfo[pid].lastRewardSecond;
} else {

period = _poolInfo[pid].rewardEndTime - _poolInfo[pid].lastRewardSecond;
lastRewardSecond = _poolInfo[pid].rewardEndTime;
}

uint256 rewardPerPeriod = period * _poolInfo[pid].rewardPerSecond + _poolInfo[pid].rewardReserve;
uint256 uncalculated = rewardPerPeriod / _poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount +
_poolInfo[pid].actualRewardPerShareAndSecond;
// If the pool is not expired yet, the period will be calculated "normally"
// The actual timestamp gets subtracted by the last time a reflow happened. (claim, deposit,
withdraw, any funding)

// If the pool expires, the reward end time (pool end timestamp) is subtracted by the last reward
second
// The reason is: when a pool gets funded after the pool expires, it is also possible to fund.
// For that the reward end time is increased and here calculats the rewards.

// calculate how many rewards are not calculated yet (also calculate in the residual if one exists)
// calculate the rewards per share (the shares are divided by 10**12 to make the calculation easier)

// residuals are stored for the next time
uint256 rest = rewardPerPeriod % _poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount;
return (uncalculated, rest, lastRewardSecond);
} else {
return (_poolInfo[pid].actualRewardPerShareAndSecond, _poolInfo[pid].rewardReserve,
_poolInfo[pid].lastRewardSecond);
}
}

## Informational

### Unused requirements

**Description**

This requirement is not used because in front of him is another requirement which does the
same work “checking that the user doesn’t try to withdraw more than he has.”. Also in your
contract impossible situation then the user withdraws the amount of staked tokens which he
has and at the same time withdraws more than pool has.
require(_allowances[sender][_msgSender()] >= amount, "transferFrom: transfer amount exceeds
allowance");

**Recommendation**:

Remove requirement:
require (wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR <= _poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount
Or swap it with requirement:
require (wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR <= _userInfo[pid][msg.sender].stakeAmount
function _withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 wAmount) internal {
require(wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR > 0, "_withdraw: Sorry, but too few to withdraw. (min. 10**12
wei)");
require(wAmount % CORRECT_DIVISOR == 0, "_withdraw: Sorry, but for the correct calculation you only
can withdraw without residual. (amount % 10 ** 12 == 0)");
require (wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR <= _userInfo[pid][msg.sender].stakeAmount, "_withdraw: Not
enough stakes in your account");
require (wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR <= _poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount, "_withdraw: Not enough stakes
in the pool");
require (_getWithdrawPossibleIn(pid, msg.sender) == 0, "_withdraw: Withdraw time is not expired");

_saveRewards(pid, 0);
_poolInfo[pid].poolT.stakedToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, wAmount);
_poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount = _poolInfo[pid].stakeAmount - (wAmount / CORRECT_DIVISOR);
// save the new staked amount of a user (the saved amount is divided by 10**12)
_userInfo[pid][msg.sender].stakeAmount = _userInfo[pid][msg.sender].stakeAmount - (wAmount /
CORRECT_DIVISOR);
if (_userInfo[pid][msg.sender].stakeAmount == 0) {
_poolInfo[pid].userCount -= 1;
}
}
