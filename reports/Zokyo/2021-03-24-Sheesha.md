# Findings

## High Risk

### Vesting logic applied to dev address is not part of the repository.

**Recommendation**:
In the scope of SHEESHA contract constructor execution, deploy new vesting contract and
pass allocated dev funds to it.

### Method transferVaultRewards & transferVaultLPewards from contract SHEESHA lets contract owner transfer rewards supply to vault multiple times.

**Recommendation**:
Decline method invocations if they already distribute executed.


### Contract owner has the ability to transfer all ETH & tokens to itself.

**Recommendation**:
Add methods to pause all contract operations & to refund supplied ETH instead of
transferring everything to the Contract owner address.

## Medium Risk

### Method emergencyDrain24hAfterLiquidityGenerationEventIsDone of contract LGE is marked with modifier payable.

**Recommendation**:
Remove payable modifier, as the method does not utilize any passed ETH to it.

## Low Risk

### Method `isUserEisting` from contract LGE has a typo.

Recommendation:
Rename method to `isUserExisting`.

## Informational

### Smart contract is not covered by NatSpec annotations.

**Recommendation**:
Cover by NatSpec all Contract methods.
