## Informational

### Order of Functions

**Description**

The functions in DeltaHubStaking contract are not grouped according to their visibility and order.

Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following way:
- constructor;
- fallback function (if exists);
- external;
- public;
- internal;
- private.
Ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and
fallback definitions easier.

**Recommendation**:
Consider changing functions order.

**Action Steps**:
Change functions order according to solidity documentations: Order of Functions.
