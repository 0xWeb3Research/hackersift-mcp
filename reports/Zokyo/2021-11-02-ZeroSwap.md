# Findings

## Low Risk

### Change the state before transferring the funds

**Description**

In Zeefarm.sol file, in releaseRewards(), move the line-164 before the line-158, that is update
the state before transferring the funds or value.

**Recommendation**:

Place the statement
user.rewardClaimed[index] += totalPending;
before
vault.safeRewardTransfer(rewardToken,msg.sender,totalPending);

**Comment**:

Since there is no chance of a reentrancy attack, the state change doesn’t affect it.
