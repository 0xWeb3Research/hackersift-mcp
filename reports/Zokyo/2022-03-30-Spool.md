# Findings

## High Risk


### Interface does not correspond to contract.

**Description**

Line 26, function withdrawAllAndUnwrap(). In the interface, it is declared that function returns
bool, however the actual contract in mainnet doesn’t return anything, thus the call to the
contract in ConvexBoosterContractHelper(line 84) always reverts.

**Recommendation**:

Fix the interface. Function withdrawAllAndUnwrap() should not return anything.

### New shares overwrite previously recorded shares.

**Description**

line 186, 189, function _saveUserShares().
Shares and proportionateDeposit should be added to balances, instead of just being assigned.
Since a user is able to perform transfer shares without withdrawing them, it is possible that a
user calls vault.withdrawFast() several times without withdrawing funds(passing boolean
variable executeWithdraw as false). This way previously recorded shares will be overwritten
with new shares and the user might lose part of his funds.

**Recommendation**:

Add variables ‘proportionateDeposit’ to ‘vaultWithdraw.proportionateDeposit’ and
‘sharesWithdrawn[i]’ to ‘vaultWithdraw.userStrategyShares[vaultStrategies[i]]’ instead of just
assigning them.

### Delegatecall to non-verified address.

**Description**

line 149, function withdraw(). Addresses from array ‘strategies’ are not verified, thus user is
able to pass any address here. Spool is making a delegate call to this address
(SpoolStrategy.sol, line 305). This might potentially cause funds loss.

**Recommendation**:

Verify any address that a user can pass to functions, and contracts are making calls to.
Answer from client.
There is no way the call happens if the strategy is not valid. Only the vault can set the user
strategy shares. If user vault shares are 0, the call is skipped. This is nice to have require to
revert if calldata is wrong, but it cannot affect the system. Also, if total withdrawn is 0, the
code reverts.

**Post-audit**.

After clarification from the client’s side, auditors came to conclusion, that validating that
strategy share is greater than zero before calling strategy is enough.

### Wrong variable passed.

**Description**

Line 725. Instead of a local variable ‘_strategies’, a storage variable ‘strategies’ is passed in
Hash.sameStrategies(), which means that ‘require’ won’t revert.

**Recommendation**:

Pass the local variable ‘_strategies’ instead.

### Loop may not reach the required array element.

**Description**

Line 178. Loop will never reach the last element with value greater than 0, since the condition
to leave the loop is ‘i < lastDepositIndex’.
For example, ‘lastDepositIndex’ is equal to 0, and ‘depositProportionsArray’ is greater than and
should be processed in the loop, however, it won’t happen.

**Recommendation**:

In order to iterate through all required array elements, use a condition ‘i <= lastDepositIndex’
instead.

### Users are unable to withdraw large deposits.

**Description**

In case user has deposited a big deposit(starting with 50 tokens approximately), redeemUser()
function fails with overflow error, which prevents the user from withdrawing funds.

**Recommendation**:

Verify, that it is possible to withdraw all deposits.

### Anyone can call a function.

**Description**

Line 568. Function notifyStrategyRemoved() is used to remove strategies from the vault,
however there are no restrictions on who is allowed to call this function. This way ,anyone can
remove all the strategies from the vault.

**Recommendation**:

Add a restriction on who is able to call function.

## Medium Risk

### Unexpected behaviour after re-adding of the deleted token

**Description**

The function forceRemoveRewards() calls for a struct that contains a mapping. Since the
mapping inside the structure cannot be deleted by such a move, reward token re-adding may
cause unexpected effect.

**Recommendation**:

Every mapping item must be deleted (set to zero). Or the token should be blacklisted.

**Post-audit**:

Reward token is blacklisted after the deletion.

### Incorrect variable passed in function.

**Description**

Line 125-126. In the ‘if’ statement ‘depositSlippageSlots’ variable is checked, however in line
126, function which validates reallocation slippages is called.

**Recommendation**:

Verify which variable should be validated in the ‘if’ statement, and what type of slippages
should be validated then.

### Function can’t be called.

**Description**

Function runDisableStrategy(). Function can be called by controller only, however there is not
implementation for calling this function in Controller.sol

**Recommendation**:

Add an implementation of call function spool.runDisableStrategy() from controller.

## Informational

### Unnecessary use of SafeMath.

**Description**


Using safeMath in Solidity version 0.8.11 is not necessary and only increases gas spendings
since Solidity of this version has a built-in check for under/overflow.

**Recommendation**:

Replace functions from SafeMath with arithmetic operators.

### Emit events.

**Description**

Functions transferVaultOwner(), lowerVaultFee(), updateName(). Setters should emit events to
log changes to storage variables.

**Recommendation**:

Add events to setter functions.
Answer from client.
Some events on vaults and spool were not added/removed to decrease contracts size. We'll
listen to external contract calls.

### Validate that the new reward token is unique.

**Description**

Function addToken(). New reward token should be validated, that it is not already in reward
tokens.

**Recommendation**:

Validate that the new reward token is unique.
Answer from client.
Updated RewardDrip.sol::LN:157: config.lastUpdateTime == 0, if lastUpdate time is more than
0 the token was already added.

### ToDo in code and commented code.

**Description**

ToDos: line 107, 122, 125, 211, 228, 233, 299, 489.
Commented code: line 178-184.
Pre-production contracts should not contain ToDos in code.

**Recommendation**:

Implement or remove ToDos.

### Unnecessary modifier.

**Description**

Line 634. Validating that strategies' length is greater than 0 is unnecessary, since any
deployed vault is validated in vaultRegistry. Validation that strategies'
length is greater than 0 is performed in Controller.sol(line 207).

**Recommendation**:

Remove modifier.
Answer from client.
If all strategies in the vault get exploited, the vault is left with 0 strategies.

### ToDo in code.

**Description**

ToDos: line 175.
Pre-production contracts should not contain ToDos in code.

**Recommendation**:

Implement or remove ToDos.
Answer from client.
Issue will be resolved in the next few days.

### ToDo in code and commented code.

**Description**

ToDos: line 118, 309, 322, 415, 422-423, 449.
Pre-production contracts should not contain ToDos in code.

**Recommendation**:

Implement or remove ToDos.

### ToDo in code and commented code.

**Description**

ToDos: line 61, 125-130, 148.
Pre-production contracts should not contain ToDos in code.

**Recommendation**:

Implement or remove ToDos. 

### ToDo in code.

**Description**

ToDos: line 64, 97-102.
Pre-production contracts should not contain ToDos in code.

**Recommendation**:

Implement or remove ToDos.

### Emit events.

**Description**

Functions setEcosystemCollector(), setTreasuryCollector(), setTreasuryFee(),
setEcosystemFee(), setRiskProviderFee(). Setters should emit events to log changes to storage
variables.

### Emit events.

**Description**

Functions setEmergencyWithdrawer(), setEmergencyRecipient(). Setters should emit events to
log changes to storage variables.

**Recommendation**:

Add events to setter functions.

**Recommendation**:

Add events to setter functions.

### Validate strategy underlying.

**Description**

Line 35 in constructor. CToken’s underlying and strategy underlying should be verified in
order to be equal.

**Recommendation**:

Validate that CToken’s underlying is equal to strategy underlying.
