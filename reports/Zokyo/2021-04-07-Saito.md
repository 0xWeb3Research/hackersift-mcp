# Findings

## Informational

### No SPDX-License-Identifier found

**Description**

Trust in smart contract can be better established if their source code is available. Since making
source code available always touches on legal problems with regards to copyright, the Solidity
compiler encourages the use of machine-readable SPDX license identifiers.

**Recommendation**:

Every source file should start with a comment indicating its license.

**Example**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
```

### Unnecessary read function

**Description**

Public variables can be accessed directly, without additional function. Contract will become
less in size and cheaper to deploy.

**Recommendation**:

Unless there is a special requirement, variable mintingNonce can be set to public and function
getMintingNonce can be removed. But, if another contract will interact with this variable, it
would be ok to keep getMintingNonce function, since this kind of interaction will be a little bit
more gas efficient.

### Unnecessary virtual and public keywords

**Description**

If the current contract isn't supposed to be inherited, no need to add a “virtual” keyword for
incrementNonce(), burn(), mint() functions.
Also, those methods don’t seem to be called internally, so public keywords can be replaced
with External.

**Recommendation**:

Unless there is a special requirement, keywords “public virtual” can be replaced with “external”
on lines 24, 43, 62.
