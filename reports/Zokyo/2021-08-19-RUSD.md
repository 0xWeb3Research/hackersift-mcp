# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Useless check

**Description**

RUSD.sol, line 67
Statement “require(_balanceFrom.sub(_amount) >= 0)” does not perform any role, since
overflow check will revert incorrect math and the result will always be true. Verify the
functionality and correct the check if it needs to guard the logic.

**Recommendation**:

Verify and correct the functionality. There will be no informative error message due to the
overflow. Rephrase to
require(_balanceFrom >= _amount, "Insufficient balance for non network member");

### Compilation failed for the latest Solidity version

**Description**

Compilation failed because of missing emit keyword for the event.
TypeError: Event invocations have to be prefixed by "emit".
--> project:/contracts/MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol:441

**Recommendation**:

Fix compilation error.

### Restriction cannot be set again

**Description**

contracts/RUSD.sol
After setting restrictions to NONE they cannot be renewed even if the restrictionRenewal is
updated. Since there is no documentation about state changes we cannot verify the
correctness. Check the functionality and confirm the correctness.

**Recommendation**:

Verify the functionality, check the correctness of state changes, add documentation and/or
fix/confirm the flow of restrictions change.

**Post-audit**

Functionality was verified by the ReSource team.

## Low Risk

### Use fixed Solidity version

**Description**

For now the contracts set uses the ^0.8.0 version of Solidity. Nevertheless it is recommended
to use the fixed version of Solidity (like 0.8.7 - the latest stable version), so there will be no
effect on the development in case of the update with missing backward compatibility, there
will be a control over the versioning. For now, for example, the contracts set does not compile
with latest versions of Solidity (starting from from 0.8.4). Also, the issue is in the standard
auditor’s checklist.

**Recommendation**:

Use fixed solidity version (0.8.7).

### Methods can be declared as external

**Description**

CIP36.creditBalanceOf(address) (CIP36.sol#38-40)
CIP36.creditLimitOf(address) (CIP36.sol#42-44)
CIP36.creditLimitLeftOf(address) (CIP36.sol#46-52)
MultiSigWallet.addOwner(address) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#114-124)
MultiSigWallet.removeOwner(address) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#128-138)
MultiSigWallet.replaceOwner(address,address) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#143-158)
MultiSigWallet.getConfirmationCount(uint256) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#450-452)
MultiSigWallet.getTransactionCount(bool,bool) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#458-461)
MultiSigWallet.getOwners() (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#465-467)
MultiSigWallet.getConfirmations(uint256) (MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#472-483)
MultiSigWallet.getTransactionIds(uint256,uint256,bool,bool)
(MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#491-507)
MutualityToken.initialize(uint256) (mutuality\MutualityToken.sol#6-9)
NetworkRegistry.initialize(address[],address[]) (NetworkRegistry.sol#66-80)
NetworkRegistry.addMember(address) (NetworkRegistry.sol#84-88)
NetworkRegistry.removeMember(address) (NetworkRegistry.sol#92-101)
NetworkRegistry.addOperator(address) (NetworkRegistry.sol#105-114)
NetworkRegistry.removeOperator(address) (NetworkRegistry.sol#118-128)
NetworkRegistry.getMembers() (NetworkRegistry.sol#135-137)
NetworkRegistry.getOperators() (NetworkRegistry.sol#141-143)
RUSD.initializeRUSD(address,uint256) (RUSD.sol#32-38)
Methods can be declared as external in order to decrease gas usage.

**Recommendation**:
Declare methods as external.

### Unused variable

**Description**

contracts/NetworkRegistry.sol#25
Variable “free” is never used in the contract and should be removed.

**Recommendation**:

Remove unused variable.

### Event invocations have to be prefixed by "emit"

**Description**

contracts/MultiSigWalletWithRelay.sol#441, addTransaction()
It is recommended to explicitly use “emit” keyword for the event to distinguish the functions
calls and events emitting per recommendation from the Solidity checklist.

**Recommendation**:

Event invocations have to be prefixed by "emit". Add prefixed by "emit".

## Informational

### Unnecessary division

**Description**

RUSD.sol:91, removeRestrictions()
Division by 1 second can be removed since it is division by 1 and timestamp is already in
seconds.

**Recommendation**:

Remove division

### Function mutability can be restricted

**Description**

RUSD.sol:52, _verifyNetworkRegistry()
Function mutability can be restricted to view. Since there are no state changes, view mutability
will decrease gas usage.

**Recommendation**:

Restrict mutability to “view”.

### Omit SafeMath usage

**Description**

Since Solidity 0.8.x has built-in support of overflow/underflow restrictions, SafeMath lib can be
safely omitted. Such solution will decrease gas usage of the contract.

**Recommendation**:

Omit SafeMath

### Re-use existing method

**Description**

contracts/CIP.sol#77, _beforeTransfer()
Function creditLimitLeftOf() can be utilized in order to remove code duplication and reduce
gas usage.

**Recommendation**:

Provide optimisation
