# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Anyone can initialize contract at Staking.sol

**Description**

Function initialize() can be called by anyone and if it fit all requires can set unexpected staking
start timestamp.

**Recommendation**:

Use modifier onlyOwner to restrict function use to the owner.

## Low Risk

### Pragma is not locked to specific version

**Description**

Since not all the EVM compiler versions support all the features, especially the latest one’s
which are kind of beta versions, So the intended behavior written in code might not be
executed as expected. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get
deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered
bugs.

**Recommendation**:

Replace pragma solidity ^0.8.0 with pragma solidity 0.8.5 at FixedPoint.sol,
DominationToken.sol, Vester.sol (or you can change solidity version for all contracts to 0.8.4 to
fix issue with incorrect warnings during analysis “Unreachable code”).

### Improper Handling of ERC20 Transfers at Vester.sol and Staking.sol

**Description**

The linked statements invoke the transfer method without validating the expected return bool
variable.
Vester.sol:

AccessControl(DomToken).grantRole(TRANSFER_ROLE, address(vester));
IERC20(DomToken).transfer(address(vester), vestingAmount);
function claim() public {
require(block.timestamp >= vestingCliff, 'Vester::claim: not time yet');
require(block.timestamp >= lastUpdate + timeout || lastUpdate == vestingBegin, 'Vester::claim:
cooldown');
uint amount;
if (block.timestamp >= vestingEnd) {
amount = dom.balanceOf(address(this));
} else {
amount = vestingAmount * (block.timestamp - lastUpdate) / (vestingEnd - vestingBegin);
lastUpdate = block.timestamp;
}
dom.transfer(recipient, amount);
}
Vester.sol:
if (partialRewards > 0) {
DOM_TOKEN.transfer(user, partialRewards);
}

**Recommendation**:

Use a wrapper library such as SafeERC20.sol by OpenZeppelin to opportunistically evaluate
the returned bool of EIP-20 transfer invocations.

### Gas optimizations

**Description**

In constructor at Staking.sol you use several requires which in final result must meet one
condition.

**Recommendation**:

You can optimize code as shown below:
if (owner != _msgSender()) {
transferOwnership(owner);
}
require(totalDOM > 0, ERROR_ZERO_AMOUNT);
require(stakingStart > block.timestamp, ERROR_PAST_TIMESTAMP);
require(
lspExpiration - STAKING_START_TIMESTAMP > REWARD_PERIOD,
ERROR_EXPIRES_TOO_SOON
);
TOTAL_DOM = totalDOM;
STAKING_START_TIMESTAMP = stakingStart;
LSP_EXPIRATION = lspExpiration;
LP_TOKEN = IERC20(lpToken);
DOM_TOKEN = IERC20(domToken);

### Additional check is required at Staking.sol

**Description**

In function stakeFor() there is no verification for the zero address for the beneficiary address.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for the zero address for beneficiary to internal function _stakeFor().

## Informational

### SPDX license identifier not provided in source file Vester.sol

**Recommendation**:

Add SPDX license identifier.
