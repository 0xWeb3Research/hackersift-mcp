# Findings

## Low Risk

### Functions should be declared as external

**Description**

Methods burn(uint256), snapshot() and transferAndCall(address,uint256,bytes) should be
declared external.

**Recommendation**:

declare methods as external

### Add check for 0 amount

**Description**

Line 29, Burn function has no checks for 0 amount. It can lead to accidental transactions,
which will be confirmed and mined but will have no effect. Though they can be misleading,
due to the errors of the caller, or errors connected to the frontend validation failure (these are
some reasons for 0 amount passed to the transaction).

**Recommendation**:

add 0 amount check (‘require()’ statement) into the mint() function.

### Unused contract

**Description**

Standard Migrations contract can be deleted.

**Recommendation**:

remove unused Migrations contract.

## Informational

### Move number to constant

**Description**

Line 21. To increase code readability and transparency we recommend to move the initial
supply from the number to the constant.

**Recommendation**:

Move initial supply to the constant.
