# Findings

## Informational

###  Variables lacks validation.

**Description**

 RailgunLogic.sol: function changeFee().
 Percentage fee variables should be verified not to exceed 100%.

 **Recommendation**:
 
 Verify that new fee variables are less than “BASIS_POINTS”

 ### Use enum instead of uint.

 **Description**

 Globals.sol: line.
 Variables “tokenType” from struct “TokenData”, “withdraw” from struct “BoundParams” are
 supposed to be assigned to a restricted range of numbers. To ensure that values of these
 variables are not out of bounds, a enum should be used as a set of constants, assigned to
 numbers, starting from 0.

 **Recommendation**:
 
 Define enum for each variable instead of using uint8
