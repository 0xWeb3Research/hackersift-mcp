# Findings

## High Risk

### User can’t get governance token unless he is the one who initially provided it

**Description**

Let’s assume User A put a governance token and got his incentive tokens. He sends some of
them to User B. But User B can’t exchange them back to governance, since contract
incentives.sol expects user A. For example in function putIncentivesTokens.

**Recommendation**:

If this is expected behaviour (incentive tokens aren't supposed to be shared), then please add
a comment that briefly explains why and how the token is supposed to be used.
But if there is no reason for sending incentives tokens anywhere but back to the incentive
contract by the same person who got them.. Then maybe you don’t even have to create a new
token. Simple record in incentives contract is enough.
Partner response for this issue:
Incentives tokens can be shared for their own purposes because they provide the possibility
to receive rewards in other networks. So this is why we need it. The point that users cannot
withdraw more governance tokens from the incentives contract than they put there is just a
part of the logic we expect.
Users can trade Incentives tokens if they want to receive more rewards from specific platform
instance, that is why there is a sense to exchange and share it.
Users may change balance of their incentives tokens to get more rewards but later, when they
want to withdraw governance tokens they can exchange incentives tokens back.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

### User can get Incentives tokens for free

**Description**

At contract incentives.sol function withdrawIncentives accepts tokenAddress and doesn’t check
if the token is actually an incentive one. So, users can pass, for example, an address of the
governance token and get it back without withdrawGovernance function.
After withdrawal governance, the user can call withdrawAllIncentives() (because his
govTokenBalances is still positive) and get every incentive token for free.
Additionally, If a user notices any token, which price > than the governance one (WBTC for
example, if someone sent it on incentives contract by mistake), he can “exchange” if for
governance token using same withdrawIncentives function.

**Recommendation**:

Check if tokenAddress is expected incentive token address.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed.

### Incentives contract does not compile

**Description**

Contract does not compile because it doesn t implement the function withdrawAllIncentives.
Also some methods mark override but they don t override anything.

**Recommendation**:

Implement function withdrawAllIncentives() external override {}, or delete it from interface
IIncentives.
Delete override mark on methods: getGovBalances, getMaxBorrowed, lockGovernance,
setCrowdsale.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed.

### Function “buyBack” can be called by anyone

**Description**

At contract PrimaryPoolERC20.sol function buyBack allows to buy back tokens for any user.
This will work if there is permission on erc20 token transfer. Although tokens can’t be stolen
this way, but it may lead to unwanted “buy backs”.

**Recommendation**:

Unless there is a special requirement, please replace
```solidity
function buyBack(address destination, uint256 tokensAmount) public {
require(destination != address(0),"Destination address is empty");
...
_collateralization.buyBack(destination, tokensAmount, collateralAmount);
emit BuyBack(tokensAmount, blackAndWhitePrice);
}
```
with, for example this:
```solidity
function buyBack(uint256 tokensAmount) public {
...
_collateralization.buyBack(msg.sender, tokensAmount, collateralAmount);
emit BuyBack(tokensAmount, blackAndWhitePrice);
}
```

In case buyBack indeed requires transferring of tokens from another address for user, please
add verification of the approved addresses.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

## Medium Risk

### Governance can replace pool and buyBack tokens for unexpected price

**Description**

At contracts CollateralizationERC20.sol, PrimaryCollateralizationERC20.sol there are 4
functions that can be called only by pool: buy, buySeparately, buyBack, buyBackSeparately.
This is good, since the functions accept both amounts: tokensAmount and payment (and don’t
check if price is fair).
At the same time, there is possibility of updating the pool (by governance, function
changePoolAddress), and withdraw lots of collateral token for very small payment.

**Recommendation**:

Remove changePoolAddress function (if possible). If not, add a comment that briefly explains
how all funds are secured. For example: governance address will be a contract that requires
voting for pool update.

**Re-audit**:

Skipped.

### Functions may become unexecutable due to potentially huge amount of allTokens array

**Description**

At contract Incentives.sol there are 4 functions with this cycle: withdrawAllIncentives,
putIncentivesTokens, userState, availableTokens.
If the array of tokens becomes significant in size (more than 500, need to perform additional
tests to get exact array size), first it will take a lot of gas to execute, then it will hit gas limits.

**Recommendation**:

If no significant amount of tokens is expected (less than 100 for example), add a comment
that confirms this. If more than 100, additional tests are required to develop a suitable
solution.
Partner response for this issue:
In possible solutions Zokyo auditors write that there is no issue if there will be less than 100
tokens in the array. I commented out that we will not have 50 tokens and most probably there
will be at max 10-20 tokens according to yhe number of blockchain networks that we will use.
This number is much less than 100 tokens border provided by your auditors. But I see that
issue is still unresolved even if I have ptovided an expected response.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed.

## Low Risk

### Unnecessary variables declaration

**Description**

At contract Bpool.sol at function getNormalizedWeight there is a denorm variable that is
actually used only once and can be removed.

**Recommendation**:

Use direct insertion, example:
return bdiv(_records[token].denorm, _totalWeight);

Worth to mention, that not all variables have to be replaced in such a manner. Some of them
indeed improve transparency of code (example: oldWeight variable in rebind function). But
overall, where possible, use direct variable/function insertion (example: joinPool function):

uint poolTotal = totalSupply();
uint ratio = bdiv(poolAmountOut, poolTotal);


uint ratio = bdiv(poolAmountOut, totalSupply());//totalSupply = poolTotal
Still perfectly readable if we use:

**Re-audit**:
Skipped.

### Unnecessary variables declaration

**Description**


Although the current code looks good, it can be a little bit more gas efficient. At contract
CollateralizationERC20.sol at function getStoredTokensAmount there are 2 new variables:
whiteTokensAmount and blackTokensAmount. But it isn't necessarily to do so just for returning
the variable.

**Recommendation**:

Replace

uint256 whiteTokensAmount = _whiteToken.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 blackTokensAmount = _blackToken.balanceOf(address(this));
return (whiteTokensAmount, blackTokensAmount);

with something, that is equally readable, for example:

return (
_whiteToken.balanceOf(address(this)), _blackToken.balanceOf(address(this))
);


Optionally this optimization could be implemented in other contracts where possible, for
example Incentives.sol (governanceTokens) or in PrimaryCollateralizationERC20.sol

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

### Unnecessary variables declaration

**Description**

Although the current code looks good, it can be a little bit more gas efficient. At contract
CollateralizationERC20.sol there are 3 new variables:

IERC20 _whiteToken;
IERC20 _blackToken;
IERC20 _collateralToken;

But it isn’t necessarily to do so, you can call token transfer directly:

IERC20(whiteTokenAddress).transfer(destination, tokensAmount)

This will save some gas on deployment + very small amount on every function call, here is
brief test that shows gas cost of deployment and transaction of two different methods:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0579c34-9274-4666-b988-54f19e75bbfd)

**Recommendation**:
Unless there is a special requirement, please replace pre stored variables with interface
wrapper.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

### Unnecessary variables declaration

**Description**

At contract Reservoir.sol at function drip there are 2 new variable, that doesn’t seem to have
any sense: target_ and token_.

**Recommendation**:

Access target and token directly, remove:
address target_ = target;
IERC20 token_ = token;

**Re-audit**:

False finding. The original code is more gas efficient than the suggested one.

### Gas efficiency could be improved

**Description**


At contract Incentives.sol, withdrawAllIncentives function there is a loop that constantly checks
allTokens array length:

for(uint256 i=0;i<allTokens.length;i++)

Also, nonReentrant protection in this case seems unnecessary, since function works only with
known tokens that don’t do any callback calls.

**Recommendation**:

Pre store tokens length in a variable before cycle, this will be a little bit more gas efficient. And
remove nonReentrant modifier.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed, although there are still several other cases across project, for example in Incentives.sol
contract in userState, availableTokens functions.

### Unnecessary variables declaration

**Description**

Although the current code looks very good, it can be a little bit more gas efficient. At contract
PrimaryPoolERC20.sol there is a function getBWprice() that creates several variables.
We can try to do some optimization, to save gas fees. It is important to keep the function well
readable as it is now.

**Recommendation**:

Replace the function with, for example, this option:

```solidity

function getBWprice() public view returns (uint256) {
// Get data from collateralization contract
uint256 curSupply = _collateralization.getWhiteSupply().add(_collateralization.getBlackSupply());
/*
Calculate token price. If current collateralization is less than default price use default price.
If token collateralization is higher than default price define new price from collateralization.
*/
if (curSupply == 0) {
return _blackAndWhitePrice;
}
uint256 newPrice = wdiv(_collateralization.getCollateralization(), curSupply);
return (newPrice > _blackAndWhitePrice) ? newPrice : _blackAndWhitePrice;
}
```
Also note spell fix at comment: define.

**Re-audit:**

Fixed (in better way than suggested one, spell check skipped though).

### Gas efficiency could be improved

**Description**

At contract Incentives.sol, putIncentivesTokens function there is a loop that constantly checks
allTokens array length:
```solidity
for(uint256 i=0;i<allTokens.length;i++)
```
Also, this check doesn’t seem to make sense:
```solidity
if(amount<users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress]){
users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress] =
users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress].sub(amount);
}else{
users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress] = 0;
}
```
Since the amount already been checked at line 130:
```solidity
require(amount>0 && users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress] >= amount,"bad amount or
tokenAddress");
```

So the else statement will always be false.

**Recommendation**:

Pre store tokens length in a variable before cycle, this will be a little bit more gas efficient. And
remove remove the if condition, keep only:
users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress] =
users[msg.sender].borrowedList[tokenAddress].sub(amount);

**Re-audit**:
Length - Fixed, else statement - Skipped.

### Unnecessary variables declaration


**Description**

At contract CollateralizationERC20.sol at function buy there are 2 new variable that used only
once:

uint256 blackAndWhitePrice = getBWprice();
uint256 oneTokenAmount = tokensAmount.div(2);

**Recommendation**:

Unless code becomes hard to read, don’t create new variable, simply insert function as
argument into another function:

uint256 tokensAmount = wdiv(payment, getBWprice());
_collateralization.buy(msg.sender, tokensAmount.div(2), payment);

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

### Unspecified revert reason

**Description**


At contract CollateralizationERC20.sol at function buy there is a condition:
require(tokensAmount >= _minBlackAndWhiteBuy);
If the transaction reverts it may be unclear why.



**Recommendation**:

Add message with brief description:

require(tokensAmount >= _minBlackAndWhiteBuy, “tokens amount is less than minimum amount”);

**Description**:
Fixed.

## Informational

### Unexpected words order

**Description**

At 6 different contracts there are 39 occurrences of “...should be not...” expression, example:
"WHITE TOKEN ADDRESS SHOULD BE NOT NULL".
I believe the correct word order is "...SHOULD NOT BE...".

**Recommendation**:

Replace "...SHOULD BE NOT NULL" with "...SHOULD NOT BE NULL". And other 38 variation of
this message.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed.


### No SPDX-License-Identifier found in: Reservoir.sol, FarmingPool.sol

**Description**

Trust in smart contracts can be better established if their source code is available. Since
making source code available always touches on legal problems with regards to copyright, the
Solidity compiler encourages the use of machine-readable SPDX license identifiers.

**Recommendation**:

Every source file should start with a comment indicating its license.
Example:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

**Re-audit**:

Fixed.
