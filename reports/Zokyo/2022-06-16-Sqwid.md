# Findings

## High Risk

### Miners are able to manipulate the result of the raffle.

**Description**

 SqwidMarketplace.sol: function endRaffle(), line 751.
 In order to determine the winner of the raffle, a pseudo-random number is generated, based
 on the information of the block. Miners are able to manipulate the transaction and some of
 the blocks in order to manipulate the outcomes of the raffle.
 
 **The issue is described in the following article**:
 https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-
 blockchain-9ced6472dbdf
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 remove to_string()
 
 **From client**:
 
 The Sqwid team states, that there are no off-chain Oracles in the Reef chain and
 opts with current solution vulnerable for miners manipulation

### Not the whole amount of REEF is transferred due to accuracy loss. SqwidMarketplace.sol: functions enterRaffle(), endRaffle().

 **Description**

 When a user enters a raffle, his message value is divided by 1e18, losing the accuracy of the 
message value, since Solidity doesn’t support float numbers. For example, if a user sends 
2500000000000000000 (2.5 REEF) and this value is divided by 1e18, the result would be 
equal 2 (instead of 2.5).
 During the execution of endRaffle(), the total value is multiplied by 1e18, giving 
2000000000000000000 (2 REEF). This way, some amount of REEF tokens might get stuck 
on contract.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Remove the division.
 
 **Post audit**:
 
 Sqwid team took this approach in order to facilitate the calculation of the pseudorandom 
winner, given that the value of 1 REEF is currently $0.0035, so Sqwid team has enough 
margin to discard that value in case of incorrectly sending a fractional part. The official 
frontend will take this into account and allow only amounts with the accuracy of 1 REEF. 
Sqwid team however added a @notice in the contract to make this fact explicit, in case the 
users want to interact directly with the smart contract or other frontends are developed.

###  Deprecated ETH transfer.

 **Description**

 Governance.sol: function withdraw(), line 163.
 SqwidMarketplace: withdraw() line 214, fundLoan() line 896, repayLoan() line 918, 
_createItemTransaction() line 1181
 Due to the Istanbul update there were several changes provided to the EVM, which made 
.transfer() and .send() methods deprecated for the ETH transfer. Thus it is highly 
recommended to use .call() functionality with mandatory result check, or the built-in 
functionality of the Address contract from OpenZeppelin library. This should be done in 
order to mitigate any possible future update of EVM for the Reef Chain.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Correct ETH sending functionality


### Iteration through the whole storage array.

  **Description**

 Governance.sol: function _resetProposals(), lines 422, 428, 432.Iteration is performed 
through several arrays with proposals, including the executed one. In case, there are a lot 
of elements in arrays, iteration might consume more gas than allowed per transaction, 
rejecting the whole transaction. Issue is marked as high, since it might prevent protocol 
from updating list of owners and minimum confirmation value
 SqwidERC1155Wrapper.sol: function _getWrappedTokenId(), line 77.Iteration through all 
wrapped tokens. In case there are a lot of tokens wrapped, function would prevent from 
wrapping new tokens due gas limit per one transaction.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Consider removing executed proposals from arrays to decrease the number of elements. 
In case, proposals should not be removed, consider to split the reset process in several 
transactions to ensure its correct execution
 Consider creating additional mapping for linking the token of external contract to 
wrapped token id instead of iteration.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 The Sqwid team has changed the structure of the Governance. Now the mappings are 
used to track proposals and arrays to store the active ones. Also, a limit of active 
proposals per owner has been added
 The way of linking external tokens with wrapped tokens has been changed as well, from 
using an array to a mapping


## Medium Risk

###  Payable function without interaction with msg.value.

  **Description**

 SqwidMarketplace.sol: function mint().
 Function is marked as payable, however there is no interaction with msg.value. All REEF, 
accidentally sent with this function will be locked on contract.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Either remove the payable modifier or add interaction with msg.value, for example, update 
of user balance with function _updateBalance().
 
 **From-client**:
 
 Payable modifier was removed by the team


## Low Risk

###  Check the supply of the token to verify that the token is ERC721.

   **Description**

 SqwidERC1155.sol: function unwrapERC721(), line 360.
 Currently, the balance of the message sender is checked to be equal 1, in order to verify that 
the token is ERC721 standard. However it is possible that other tokens from this set would 
be on other users’ balances and the balance of the message sender would be 1.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Check the supply of the token.
 
 **From-client**:
 
 According to the Sqwid team, the purpose of the validation was to ensure, user has enough 
balance of token. However, for the sake of clearness in the error returned, a new validation 
of the correctness of the token standard has been added in both unwrapERC721 and 
unwrpERC1155 functions

## Informational

###  Validate correctness of proposal before creating.

   **Description**

 Governance.sol: functions proposeOwnersChange(), proposeMinConfirmationsChange().
 Currently, the correctness of values passed to proposals are verified in functions 
executeOwnersChange() in lines 323, 328 and executeMinConfirmationsChange() in lines 
404. The correctness of a proposal is not verified during its creation, allowing users to flood 
the system with incorrect proposals and increase the amount of elements in proposals’ 
arrays.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Validate the correctness of proposal in functions proposeOwnersChange(), 
proposeMinConfirmationsChange().

 **From-client**:
 
 Validations have been added in the moment of proposal creation

### Proposals have no deadline.


 **Description**

 Proposals are not limited in timeline, which means that some proposals might be voted for 
later, when they appear not to be actual for protocol. Such behavior might be potentially 
used by malicious actors(In case owners are compromised).

 **Recommendation**:
 
 Verify the correctness of current functionality or add a deadline, after which, the proposal 
cannot be executed.

 **From-client**:
 
 A deadline has been added to all proposals


### Validate tokenURI parameter.

 **Description**

 SqwidERC1155.sol: functions mint(), mintBatch().
 Parameter “tokenURI” in function mint() and values from array parameter “tokenURIs” lack 
validation that strings are not empty.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Validate the fact that provided tokenURIs are not empty strings

###  Unused function.

  **Description**

 SqwidERC1155.sol: function _asSingleftonArray().
 Private function _asSingleftonArray() is defined, however it is not used across the code.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Remove unused function

###  Unused import.

 **Description**

 NftMimeTypes.sol: import of ERC165.sol.
 Imported contract is neither inherited nor used as interface
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Remove unused imports


###  Constant usage is preferred.

 **Description**

 NftRoyalties.sol: royaltyInfo(), line 29.
 SqwidMarketPlace,sol: fundLoan(), line 892; _createItemTransaction() line 1175
 The number 10000 is used as the accuracy divider, thus it is preferable to have it as constant 
so its usage will be consistent across the contracts
 The same applies to royalty value check in NftRoyalties.sol, _setTokenRoyalty(), line 54 - 
verify that 5000 value should be set as constant or can be changeable by the admin.
 
 **Recommendation**:
 
 Consider constant usage.
 
 **From-client**:
 
 The value of the accuracy divider will not be used outside the contract and thus shouldn’t 
be moved to a separate constant.
 The max royalty value, however, has been converted into a constant, so that it can be 
referenced in other contracts
