# Findings

## Medium Risk

### The contract owner has too many permissions

**Description**

The rewardCutoff functionally allows the owner to change the last block number when the
user can farm rewards. It means that the owner can add a new pool, wait for investors to
invest and then change rewardCutoff to current block + 1. It may have unexpected behavior
for potential investors.

**Recommendation**:

Make changes of rewardCutoff in a way when the owner can’t set less then initial value.

**Re-audit**:

They will use multisig for the owner, so the owner can’t remove all rewards by himself.

### Function call may run out of gas

**Description**

The mass update pool allows the contract to update all pools data in one call. It can be the
cause of run out of gas if poolInfo.length will be a big number.

**Recommendation**:

There are few possible solutions:
Make a comment to explain that poolInfo.length won't be a big number;
Make additional requirements in the add function;
Use updatePool with pool index instead of massUpdatePools.

**Re-audit**:

Issue is resolved by using updatePool with pool id.

## Informational

### Withdraw function can be called with 0 value

**Description**


Withdraw function can be called with 0 amount of token to withdraw, and function doesn’t
have equirement:
require(amount > 0, "can't withdraw 0 tokens");
It causes that function to do more work than it needs.

**Recommendation**:

Add requirement in withdraw function.
