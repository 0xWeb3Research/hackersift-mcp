# Findings

## Low Risk

### Useless function getOwner() in the contract ERC20. To get the owner of the contract you can use the owner() function from the Ownable contract.

**Recommendation**:

Consider removing the getOwner() function to reduce the gas cost while the deployment.

### Solidity 0.8 includes a check of arithmetic operations by default, hence SafeMath is unnecessary.

**Recommendation**:

Consider removing the SafeMath library to optimize the contract size and gas usage.

## Informational

### Multiple Contracts Per File. The Mimirtoken file contains few independent contracts, libraries, and interfaces: Context, Ownable, SafeMath, Address, IERC20, ERC20, and MIMIRToken. This does not follow the Solidity style guide and makes the code harder to read.

**Recommendation**:
Use the separate files for each contract or just use the imports of OpenZeppelin standard for
the contract such as Context, Ownable, SafeMath, Address, IERC20, ERC20.

### The docstrings of the contracts and functions are partially following the Ethereum Natural Specification Format (NatSpec). Consider adding the relevant missing tags to all functions of the MIMIRToken contract.

### Unnecessary public visibility in some functions which are not used locally in the contracts.

**Recommendation**:

Change the public with external visibility for functions that are not used locally in the contracts
to reduce gas costs.

### The _cap variable in the contract ERC20 is initialized while the contract is created and does not change anywhere in the contract code, so it is a constant value.

**Recommendation**:

Consider marking the _cap variable as CONSTANT.

**Re-audit**:

Not valid since the variable was deleted.

### According to the style guide function argumentsâ€™ names should be in mixedCase.

**Recommendation**:

In the constructor of the ERC20 contract change the naming of the arguments from the
CapWords to mixedCase as follow:
constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) {}

### For more code clarity consider moving the extra added functionality from the ERC20 contract to the MIMIRToken contract such as cap() and public mint() function. And in this case move the require from _mint() function to public mint() function:
require(totalSupply().add(amount) <= cap(), "only 100 million MIMIR Exist");

### Follow the one style for error messages in the contracts.

**Recommendation**:

Consider changing the error message in ERC20 contract related to exceeding the cap as
follow:
require(totalSupply().add(amount) <= cap(), "ERC20: only 100 million MIMIR Exist");
**Re-audit**:
Not valid since require was deleted


### Misleading comment in line 954, contract MMIRToken:
* @notice Delegate votes from `msg.sender` to `delegatee`
* @param delegator The address to get delegatee for
/*
function delegates(address delegator)
external
view
returns (address)
return _blackAndWhitePrice;
{
return _delegates[delegator];
}

**Recommendation**:
Consider changing the comment to describe what the function really do:
@notice Get the delegatee of the delegator

**Re-audit**:
Not valid since the function was deleted.
