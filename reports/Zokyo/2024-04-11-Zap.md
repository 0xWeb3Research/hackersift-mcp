# Findings

## High Risk

### Unrestricted call to destroyInstance

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Locaton**: Admin.sol

**Description**

The `destroyInstance()` function within the smart contract poses a significant security risk due to its unrestricted accessibility. Any wallet or address can call this function, allowing any caller to delete the registered instance. This unrestricted access can have a severe impact on the ongoing operation of the smart contract, potentially leading to unauthorized destruction of critical contract components and disruption of essential functionalities.

```solidity
   function destroyInstance(
        address _instance
    ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
        _removeFromSales(_instance);
        ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
    }
```

**Recommendation** 

Implement Access Control: Restrict access to the `destroyInstance()` function by implementing permission modifiers or access control mechanisms. 


### Reentrance can lead to loss of funds

**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Vesting.sol, the method `claim()` allows users to claim the deposited tokens once the vesting time is over.

Since the deposited asset can be ETH/Native token as well, it will be sent to the user as per the following logic:
```solidity
if (pctAmount != 0) {
           if (address(token) == address(1)) {
               (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); 
               require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
           } else {
               token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
           }
           s.index = uint128(i);
           s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
       }
```
Here, Sending Ether is transferring the access of execution to the `sender` account, and then the `sender` account can call the `claim` method again. Since `s.index` is still not updated, the `pctAmount` will be calculated again and the same amount of ETH will be sent to the `sender`.

The sender can repeat this process until no ETH/native token is left in the contract. This way `sender` can steal all the ETH/native tokens from the contract.

This happens due to no reentrancy protection and not following the CEI (Check-Effects-Interaction) pattern.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `s.index` and `s.amountClaimed` before sending assets to the user. Also, check `s.amountClaimed` if necessary before the claim. Finally, add OZ Reentrancy guard as well.

### Incorrect Return Of `userMaxAllc`

**Severity** - High

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

In the contract TokenSale.sol the function `calculateMaxAllocation` calculate the max allocation for the user (L259) . The function incorrectly assign `userMaxAlloc` as the max allocation then `userMaxAlloc > maxAllocation` , in this case `maxAllocation` should have been assigned , therefore the allocation for the user would go beyond the max allowed allocation.

**Recommendation**:

Change the statement to 
```solidity
if (userMaxAllc > maxAllocation) {
            return maxAllocation;
 ```

### Incorrect decimals precision

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `_processPrivate(...)` calculates the amount as below:
```solidity
Staked storage s = stakes[_sender];
       uint256 amount = _amount * PCT_BASE; 
       uint256 sum = s.amount + amount;
```
Here, `amount = 1e6 * 1e18 =  1e24`, if `_amount` is in USDC decimals 6.
Further same amount is transferred from user’s wallet here:
```solidity
usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), amount);
```
Since USDC has 6 decimals and amount is in 1e24, the amount transferred from user's wallet will be a lot more than it should be.
Similarly, `userTaxAmount` is in the same precision and transferred in the same way.
```solidity
if (userTaxAmount > 0) {
           s.taxAmount += userTaxAmount;
           usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, marketingWallet, userTaxAmount);        }
```
Further state variables use the same decimal precision and the state is updated as follows:
```solidity
s.amount += uint128(amount);
state.totalPrivateSold += uint128(amount);
```
Here `s.amount` and `state.totalPrivateSold` is being updated in 1e24 decimals.

If USDC decimals are 18, the situation will be much worse as now all values will be in 1e36.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `_processPrivate` method to correctly calculate the values in proper decimals.

### Method `takeUSDCRaised()` transfer wrong funds

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `takeUSDCRaised()` calculates earned USDC as follows:


```solidity
       uint256 earned;


       if (state.totalPrivateSold > state.totalSupplyInValue) {
           earned = uint256(state.totalSupplyInValue);
       } else {
           earned = uint256(state.totalPrivateSold);
       }
```
Here, `state.totalPrivateSold` is in 1e24 and `state.totalSupplyInValue` is in 1e18 so most likely `earned` will be `state.totalSupplyInValue` which will not be correct since real USDC balance can be less than `totalSupplyInvalue`.

Further, the following is checked if earned >= real USDC balance:
```solidity

       if (earned > 0) { 
           uint256 bal = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
           uint256 returnValue = earned <= bal ? earned : bal;
           usdc.safeTransfer(admin.wallet(), returnValue);
       }
```
Here `earned` is in 1e18 but `bal` is in 1e6 since USDC has 6 decimals. So again, `returnValue` will be always `earned` which is 1e18 which is a lot more than what should be transferred to `admin.wallet`.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `_processPrivate` logic to ensure correct decimals for `state.totalPrivateSold`. Further, ensure that `earned` and `bal` are in the same decimal precision before comparing and transferring the amount to admin.

### Method `_claim(...)` calculates wrong shares and left values

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method _claim has the following logic:
```solidity
  uint256 left;
       if (state.totalPrivateSold > (state.totalSupplyInValue)) {            uint256 rate = (state.totalSupplyInValue * PCT_BASE) /
               state.totalPrivateSold;
           _s.share = uint120((uint256(_s.amount) * rate) / PCT_BASE); 
           left = uint256(_s.amount) - uint256(_s.share);
       } else {
           _s.share = uint120(_s.amount);        }


       return (_s.share, left);
```
Here, `state.totalPrivateSold` is in 1e24, and `state.totalSupplyInValue` is in 1e18 which will make the `if` condition mostly true leading to rate, share, and left value being calculated wrong.

Further, rate =  1e18 * 1e18 / 1e24 = 1e8
 And share =  1e24 * 1e8 / 1e18 = 1e14
And left = 1e24 - 1e14.

Here all values are calculated in wrong decimals.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the `_processPrivate` logic to ensure correct decimals for `state.totalPrivateSold`. Further calculate the rate, share, and left in correct decimals.


### Unrestricted call to `setConfig`


**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved



**Location:** TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

The `setConfig()` function within the smart contracts poses a significant security risk due to
its unrestricted accessibility. Any wallet or address can call this function, allowing any caller
to delete the registered instance. The validation in this function `require(creator ==
_creator,"Only Creator can Call");` checks that the `_creator` is the registered
creator recorded in the contract state. But this check does not hinder the attacker because
the attacker can simply call this function with the intended `_creator = creator` in order to
carry out this call successfully.
```solidity
function setConfig(Config memory _config, address _creator) external {
require(creator == _creator,"Only Creator can Call");
config = _config;
}
```
This unrestricted access can have a severe impact on the ongoing operation of the smart
contract, potentially leading to unauthorized destruction of critical contract components and
disruption of essential functionalities. Attacker is capable of changing the config without
the consent of the creator.

**Recommendation:**

Validate that msg.sender is the registered creator.

### Incorrect Claim Logic


**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**description**
 
Users can claim the extra USDB (same issue for TokenSaleETH.sol) using the function `claim`
in TokenSaleUSDB.sol , if `s.left > 0` that would mean there are USDB to claim , `s.left` is
compared with the current balance of USDB in the contract at L263 to calculate “left” , these
left tokens are then transferred to the user.

But the `s.left` updated at L265 is incorrect , instead of deducting left from `s.left` , the whole of
`s.left` is deducted and emptied out , therefore in a condition where the contract had
insufficient USDB to fulfill the claim the `s.left` would be emptied anyhow and the user won’t
be able to claim the rest .

**Recommendation:**

Change the update to `s.left -= left`

### Incorrect Decimals For `unsoldTokens`

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

In the contract `TokenSaleETH` (same issue in TokenSaleUSDB) , in the function
`takeUSDBRaised()` the `unsoldTokens` are calculated as `(unsold * (10 ** ETH_DECIMAL))/
tokenPrice` , this amount is the amount of ‘`tokenAddress`’ tokens therefore should be in
`tokenAddress` decimals , but the above formula always returns in 1e18 rather than
`tokenAddress` decimals . Therefore if say the `tokenAddress` is a token with 12 decimals then
the `unsoldTokens` would still be in 1e18 which would be a value 1e6 times higher than
expected.

**Recommendation:**

Normalise the decimals accordingly (a division by decimal difference).

### Vesting Logic Would Keep Reverting For An Edge Case

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The normal flow in the system is , users deposit , they deposit is raised and liquidity is added
to pancakeSwap and users can vest their shares using the function `vesting()` .
In the contract `TokenSaleUSDB` (same for `TokenSaleETH.sol`) the `decimalDifference` is
calculated at L281 which is used to normalise the `amountFinal` . But if the `tokenAddress’s`
decimal is more than 18 then the calculation at L281 would always revert due to overflow.
Therefore a malicious user can create a `TokenSale` where token is a token with 22 decimals
and make the users deposit their share into the pool , but the users would never be able to
claim their vest due to the overflow error .

**Recommendation:**

Restrict token to 18 decimals or normalise accordingly.

## Medium Risk


### Lack of ERC20 Token Transfer Validation


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved



**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**

Function `createPoolNew()` initiates ERC20 token transfers without validating the return
value of the transfer operation. This oversight can result in unhandled transfer failures,
compromising the contract's functionality and exposing it to potential vulnerabilities.
```solidity
310 IERC20D(_params.tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, instance,
(_params.totalSupply + _params.tokenLiquidity));
```
There are also two occurrences in TokenSaleUSDB.sol in lines 236, 246:
```solidity
236 if(params.tokenLiquidity - tokenAmount > 0)
IERC20D(params.tokenAddress).transfer(creator, params.tokenLiquidity -
tokenAmount);
...
246 if (liquidity > 0) IERC20D(pair).transfer(creator,liquidity);
```

**Risks:** Unintended Consequences: Failing to validate token transfers may lead to unhandled
failures, causing unintended consequences in contract state and potentially resulting in
financial losses.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure secure and reliable ERC20 token transfers, it is recommended to use `SafeERC20`
Library to ensure safe and reliable token transfers, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
associated with ERC20 token handling.

**Fix** - Issue is addressed in commit 021212d and Fixed.

### Missing `disableInitializers` Call in Proxy Upgradeable Contract Constructor

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

A concern arises due to the usage of a proxy upgradeable contract without calling
`disableInitializers` in the constructor of the logic contract. This oversight introduces a severe
risk, allowing potential attackers to initialize the implementation contract itself.

**Recommendation:**

Call `disableInitializers`: Include a call to `disableInitializers` in the constructor of
the logic contract.

### Incorrect Calculation Of `amountFinal`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

In contract `TokenSaleETH.sol` (same for `TokenSaleUSDB.sol`) when `vesting()` is called it
calculates the `amountFinal` value at L261 . When there is no decimal difference and the
calculated amount is less than balance then that calculated amount is assigned as
`amountFinal` , else the balance is the `amountFinal`.

If there is a decimal difference and the calculated amount is more than balance then that
amount is assigned as the `amountfinal` which is incorrect , we should assign bal in this case
as `amountFinal` , the code is assigning a higher value than the available balance to the
`amountfinal`.

**Recommendation:**

Change the code as suggested.

### 0 Slippage Protection

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

When Liquidity is added to the pancake router , the `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` params
are being passed as 0 (L231 and L232 in TokenSaleUSDB , same for TokenSaleETH) which
essentially means 0 protection against slippage impacts , these values should be assigned
to a non-zero safe value to ensure the slippage is within accepted range.

**Recommendation:**

Assign the values to non-zero values.

### Centralization due to `destroy()` method

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `destroy()` self-destructs the contracts and sends all funds to the admin wallet. 

Since only the admin can call this method, the security of the funds in the contract is very much centralized.

**Recommendation**: 

It is advised to decentralize the usage of these functions by using a multi-sig wallet with at least 2/3 or a 3/5 configuration of trusted users. Alternatively, a secure governance mechanism can be utilized for the same.

### `selfDestruct` Would Not Remove The `ByteCode` Of The Contract

**Severity** - Medium

**Status** - Resolved

**Description**

The current instance of the TokenSale contract can be destroyed and the funds would be sent to the wallet address (L192 TokenSale.sol) , but the `selfDestruct` is deprecated now and the bytecode would still exist even after `selfDestruct`.

This can have varying effect on the users since they can still interact with the old instance (can be used for phishing purposes too).

**Recommendation**:

The risks for using `selfDestruct` should be acknowledged. 

### Missing `disableInitializers` Call in Proxy Upgradeable Contract Constructor

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

Location: Vesting.sol, TokenSale.sol, Admin.sol

**Description**

A concern arises due to the usage of a proxy upgradeable contract without calling `disableInitializers` in the constructor of the logic contract. This oversight introduces a severe risk, allowing potential attackers to initialize the implementation contract itself.

**Recommendation** 

Call disableInitializers: Include a call to `disableInitializers` in the constructor of the logic contract as recommended by OpenZeppelin here .

## Low Risk


### Non-upgradeable contracts inherited

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Unresolved

**Description**

Across the protocol, several contracts that are upgradeable are using the following import for AccessControl contract:

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

Instances:

Vesting.sol
Admin.sol

OpenZeppelin has provided an upgradeable version of the same contract and that needs to be used here.

The same goes for any other OpenZeppelin Contract to be imported in an upgradeable contract.

**Recommendation**:

Import the OZ’s contracts as described here.

### Missing validation for vesting points

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Vesting.sol, the method `initialize(...)` sets the vesting points as follows:
`(vestingPoints, ) = ascendingSort(_vestingPoints);`

Here, vesting points are ordered as per the timestamp value but do not check if the time values are in the past.

`Claim ()` can be done immediately if any past value is set.

**Recommendation**: 

Validate that both points’ timestamp value is >= block.timestamp. 

### Parameter `privateTokenPrice` is not validated

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Admin.sol, the method `_checkingParams` has validation all the fields of the Struct param except `privateTokenPrice`.

It needs to be validated to make sure that it is an appropriate value and not 0. Since this value is further used to calculate the total supply value for a `Tokensale`, it must not be 0 otherwise there would be unexpected results.

**Recommendation**: 

Validate the parameter privateTokenPrice.

### Make Sure The Token In removeOtherERC20 Is Not The Token To Be Claimed

**Severity** - Low

**Status** - Acknowledged

**Description**

Users can claim their tokens using the `claim()` function in the Vesting.sol , there’s also another functionality “`removeOtherERC20`” which rescues ERC20’s accidentally sent to the contract . If the token address provided in the function is the address of the token to be claimed then the users won’t be able to claim their rewards .

**Recommendation**:

Make sure the token address is not the token to be claimed.

### Previous staking contracts’ STAKING role is not revoked

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Admin.sol, the method `setStakingContract` can set the new staking contract and give the STAKING role to that new contract.

In case, the staking contract is set/reset more than once, there would be multiple contracts with the STAKING role and this will allow all of those contracts to access methods that need to be accessed only by the current `stakingContract` as per logic.


### Unsafe cast

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Partially resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method initialize calculated the totalSupplyInValue as follows: 
```solidity
state.totalSupplyInValue = uint128(            (uint256(_params.totalSupply) *
               uint256(_params.privateTokenPrice)) / 10 ** 18            // removes USDB hardcode of six, awful
       );
```
Here, `uint256` value is cast to `uint128` unsafely.

In `_claim(..)` method `s.share` is calculated as following:
```solidity
 _s.share = uint120((uint256(_s.amount) * rate) / PCT_BASE);
```
Here also `uint256` value is cast to `uint120` unsafely.

**Recommendation**: 

Use OZ’s SafeCast library.

### Flawed logic in `_processPrivate()` method

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `_processPrivate()` has the following logic:

```solidity
       if (sum > taxFreeAllcOfUser) { //@audit always true
           uint256 userTxRate = userTaxRate(sum, _sender);
           if (s.amount < taxFreeAllcOfUser) { //@audit true only once
               userTaxAmount = //@audit unreachable code after once
                   ((sum - taxFreeAllcOfUser) * userTxRate) /
                   POINT_BASE;
           } else {
               userTaxAmount = (amount * userTxRate) / POINT_BASE;           }
       }
```


Here, `sum = s.amount + _amount`, since `_amount > 0 => sum > 0`.
So the condition `sum > taxFreeAllOfUser` wil always be true as `taxFreeAllOfUser` is 0.
Similarly the condition `s.amount < taxFreeAllOfUser` can be true only once when s.amount == 0 but even in that case, userTaxAmount will be `amoiunt * userTxRate / POINT_BASE` only.

**Recommendation**: 

Update the above logic with proper checks and conditions.

### CEI pattern not followed

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `claim()` does not follow the CEI pattern as it transfers USDC to the users first (if `s.taxAmount > 0`) and then updates the `s.claimed` status. Here since it’s USDC tokens, reentrancy is not possible but ensuring CEI pattern is advised.


**Recommendation**: 

Update the logic to follow CEI pattern.

### Vulnerability to frontrunning due to interplay between claim() and takeUSDCRaised()

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: TokenSale.sol

**Description**


The smart contract includes two distinct functions, `claim()` and `takeUSDCRaised()`, each serving specific purposes within the contract's functionality.
`claim()`: This function is designed to be callable by users, allowing them to claim certain benefits or rewards. Importantly, it is structured to be callable only once per user, ensuring fair distribution of benefits and preventing abuse or excessive claims.

`takeUSDCRaised()`: Conversely, `takeUSDCRaised()` is intended to be called only once in the smart contract lifespan, typically to distribute earnings or funds to an administrative wallet.
However, there exists a vulnerability arising from the interplay between these functions. When users call `claim()`, it affects their account balances within the contract. These balances, in turn, directly impact the amount that can be withdrawn or distributed when `takeUSDCRaised()` is subsequently called.

**Vulnerability Scenario**:

A potential attacker could exploit this relationship between `claim()` and `takeUSDCRaised()` to carry out frontrunning attacks. By repeatedly calling `claim()` to manipulate their account balances, the attacker can influence the amount available for withdrawal during the execution of `takeUSDCRaised()`. This manipulation can result in a negative impact on the intended distribution of earnings, potentially leading to financial losses or discrepancies.

**Recommendation** 

In order to ensure that `claim()` is called only after takeUSDCRaised() is once called, function `claim()` needs to check the variable `isRaiseClaimed`. This variable acts as a flag set to true once `takeUSDCRaised()` is called.

### Changeable length of `vestingPoints` leading to issues

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Vesting.sol

**Description**

Function `updateVestingPoints()` changes the array `vestingPoints`, while it is worth noting that caution is not taken on updating the value of this array. A new `vestingPoints` array with a different length can result in undesired behaviour. For instance assume the new `vestingPoints` is set to an array value with fewer elements (i.e. smaller length), the validation in function `claim()` : require(s.index != vestingPoints.length, "already claimed"); is passed successfully despite the fact that this index should have been already claimed. New value of `vestingPoints` should be consistent with older value.

**Recommendation** 

Apply a constraint (i.e. require statement) to condition the new array value of `vestingPoints` in order to avoid inconsistentencies that might arise.

### Modifiers duplicated

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Admin.sol

**Description**

Functions `addOperator()` and `removeOperator()` carry out redundant checks. Modifier `onlyAdmin` checks whether the caller is wallet or not (i.e. owner of contract as referred to in initialize ). Function `grantRole` as well carry out the same check: `onlyRole(getRoleAdmin(role))` which verifies that the role admin of `OPERATOR` is the caller of this function. The role admin of `OPERATOR` and `onlyAdmin` are both verifying that the caller is wallet.
```solidity
   function addOperator(address _address) external virtual onlyAdmin {
        grantRole(OPERATOR, _address);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Only Admin can remove an Operator
     */

    function removeOperator(address _address) external virtual onlyAdmin {
        revokeRole(OPERATOR, _address);
    }
```
This finding could have been more serious if there is a chance that role admin of OPERATOR be another account. As a result one modifier will contradict the other resulting in blocking the call of that function resulting in a denial of service.

**Recommendation** 

Use internal functions: `_grantRole` and `_revokeRole` in the implementations of `addOperator` and `removeOperator` instead.


### Reentrance Attack Exploit in `claim()` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** TokenSaleETH.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**


The `claim()` function is susceptible to a reentrancy attack due to its design allowing
external calls (i.e. line 240) to be made to other contracts (i.e. `msg.sender`) before the
completion of its own state changes and balance updates. An attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by invoking the `claim()` function and subsequently reentering it multiple times,
potentially draining the contract s funds by manipulating its state or performing unauthorized
transfers.
```solidity
225 function claim() external {
226 require(isRaiseClaimed, "takeUSDBRaised not called");
227 require(
228 uint8(epoch) > 1 && !admin.blockClaim(address(this)),
229 "Not time or not allowed"
230 );
231
232 Staked storage s = stakes[msg.sender];
233 require(s.amount != 0, "No Deposit");
234 if(s.share == 0) (s.share, s.left) = _claim(s);
235 require(s.left != 0, "Nothing to Claim");
```

```solidity
237 if(s.left > 0){
238 uint bal = address(this).balance;
239 uint left = s.left < bal ? s.left : bal;
240 ETHTransfer(msg.sender, left);
241 s.left -= s.left;
242 emit Claim(msg.sender, left);
}
}
```

**Recommendation:**

**Use Reentrancy guard**: Implement reentrancy guard or state variables to prevent reentrancy
by blocking reentrant calls to the `claim()` function while a transaction is in progress.

**Fix** - Issue is addressed in commit 021212d and partially resolved. Reentrancy guard is
added to the contract and nonReentrant modifier is being applied to the function. The issue
now is effectively mitigated but it is worth noting that ReentrancyGuard being used is not an
upgradeable version.

It is also recommended that `s.left -= left;` be executed before ETHTransfer(msg.sender,
left); since using checks-effects-interactions pattern helps mitigate that exploitation.

**Fix** - Issue revisited in commit 1474b46 in which client moved `s.left -= left` before
`ETHTransfer` to abide by CEI pattern this in turn lowers the severity of reentrancy.

**Fix**: At commit 5c0e17cb92 : Both `TokenSaleETH.sol` and `TokenSaleUSDB.sol` inherit the
Upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard as suggested , however it is not initialized to the
proper state in Function initialize.

### Non-upgradeable contracts inherited

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**

Across the protocol, several contracts that are upgradeable are inheriting non upgradeable
Base Contracts:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```
OpenZeppelin has provided an upgradeable version of the same contracts and that needs to
be used here.
The same goes for any other OpenZeppelin Contract to be imported in an upgradeable
contract.

**Recommendation:**

Import the OZ’s contracts as described here.

**Fix**: At commit 5c0e17cb92 : Client inherited the required upgradeable contracts and
initialized them in the initialize function in Admin.sol. In both TokenSaleETH.sol and
TokenSaleUSDB.sol the Upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard is inherited as suggested ,
however it is not initialized to the proper state in Function initialize.

## Informational

### Redundant check

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method deposit checks the following:
```solidity
       require(_amount > 0, "TokenSale: 0 deposit");
```


And the method deposit calls `_processPrivate` which also checks:
```solidity
require(_amount > 0, "TokenSale: Too small");
```
Since `_processPrivate` is called only by `deposit()` method, this check is redundant.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the redundant check.

### Unnecessary local variable in method `usertaxRate()`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, the method `userTaxRate()` has the following logic:
```solidity
uint256 userTaxFreeAllc = 0;


       if (_amount > userTaxFreeAllc) { … }
```
This condition could simply be ` if (_amount > 0)` and there is no need of the variable `usertaxFreeAllc`.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unnecessary local variable.

### Remove `console.log`

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract TokenSale.sol, there is a `console.log` statement that should be removed before production deployment.

**Recommendation**: 

Remove the unused logs.

### Unused imports

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Description**

In Contract Admin.sol, the following import is unused.
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```
In TokenSale.sol, the following import is unused.
```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
```

**Recommendation**: 

remove the unused imports.

### Testnet Addresses Used

**Severity** - Informational

**Status** - Partially Resolved

**Description**

The USDC and wallet addresses used in TokenSale.sol (L88 and L89) are addresses meant for testnet and not for mainnet , these should be corrected before launch.

**Recommendation**:

Change the addresses to mainnet addresses.
**Fix** - Issue is unaddressed and remains unresolved (commit 65e4d1c). 
**Fix** - Commit    - fixed for the address of usdc. marketingWallet still assigned 0x6507fFd283c32386B6065EA89744Ade21515e91E which does not exist in the network. 

### Floating Pragma Version in Solidity Files

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: All

**Description**

The Solidity files in this codebase contain pragma statements specifying the compiler version in a floating manner (e.g., ^0.8.0, ^0.8.4, ^0.8.11). Floating pragmas can introduce unpredictability in contract behavior, as they allow automatic adoption of newer compiler versions that may introduce breaking changes.

**Recommendation**: 

To ensure stability and predictability in contract behavior, it is recommended to:
Specify Fixed Compiler Version: Instead of using a floating pragma, specify a fixed compiler version to ensure consistency across different deployments and prevent automatic adoption of potentially incompatible compiler versions.

### Lack of Event Emission in Privileged Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Vesting.sol, VestingFactory.sol, TokenSale.sol, Admin.sol

**Description**

During the security audit of the smart contract, an issue has been identified in the implementation of privileged functions, one example is function setOperator(address). The codebase has not incorporated event emission within several of these privileged functions. The absence of events in these operations limits transparency, hindering the ability to monitor and track critical changes to the contract's state.

**Recommendation** 

Emit the relevant events on calling privileged functions.
Fix - Finding is addressed in Admin.sol only in commit 65e4d1c. While in the rest of the contracts mentioned, most privileged functions are called without emitting events.
Fix - Fixed in e5cb23a.

### Blacklisting is irreversible

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Admin.sol

**Description**

In function `addToBlacklist`, addresses are blacklisted without any chance to go back from it. Once function is called against a given address even by mistake the admin can not remove that item from blacklist.

**Recommendation**

It is a sound suggestion to implement a function that removes address from blacklist.

### Unnecessary Safe Math is being utilized

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location**: Vesting.sol, TokenSale.sol, Admin.sol

**Description**

The default safe math operation in solidity versions ^0.8.x incurs extra gas overhead due to it requiring more computation. The following operation, that is being carried out on the iterator of the for-loop, can be more gas-efficient by using the unchecked statement.
One example in Vesting.sol:
```solidity
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
```
Preferrable to implement it as such:
```solidity
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length;) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```
**Recommendation** 

Utilize the use of unchecked whenever possible as long as arithmetic safety is ensured within the context of calculation.


### The address of USDB refers to a test chain

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol

**description**

In function `initialize()` it is noted that contract not ready to operate properly because
address of USDB refers to the testnet while it should be

```solidity
0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003.
57 function initialize(address _owner) public initializer {
58 _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _owner);
59 _setRoleAdmin(OPERATOR, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE);
60 wallet = _owner;
61 platformFee = 2 * (10 ** 17);
62 platformTax = 500;
63 USDB = 0xA9F81589Cc48Ff000166Bf03B3804A0d8Cec8114;
}
```
### Lack of Event Emission in Privileged Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

During the security audit of the smart contract, an issue has been identified in the
implementation of privileged functions, one example is function
`setMasterContractUSDB(addres )`. The codebase has not incorporated event emission
within several of these privileged functions. The absence of events in these operations limits
transparency, hindering the ability to monitor and track critical changes to the contract's
state.

**Recommendation:**

Emit the relevant events on calling privileged functions.

**Fix** - Issue has been addressed in commit 021212d and partially resolved. The issue in
contracts `TokenSaleUSDB` and `TokenSaleETH` is not being addressed. Functions like
`setUSDB` and `setConfig` are admin functions that are being invoked making significant
privileged changes without announcing these changes.

### Redundant Checks

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The check at L261 (`TokenSaleUSDB.sol`) is redundant , this is because the require statement
at L259 ensures `s.left` is more than 0.

Another instance is check at L181 TokenSale.sol , this check would always be true due to the
require statement at L174.


**Recommendation:**

The if condition can be removed.

### Confusing Function Name And Comments


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The function `takeUSDBRaised()` in the contract `TokenSaleETH.sol` does not take the USDB
raised in the epoch rather it’s the ETH that was deposited in the round , it should be named
accordingly . Plus , all the comments in the contract has been copied from the
`TokenSaleUSDB` contract and should be changed.

Recommendation:

Change the comments and the function name accordingly.

### Improving Clarity and Functionality of setConfig Method

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**


The setConfig function is unclear and could lead to confusion. The function appears to
intend that only the creator of the contract should call it. However, the actual caller in the
context of the protocol is the Admin contract via the createPoolNew function. This
discrepancy may cause misunderstanding for developers attempting to interact with the
contract.
Furthermore, the function is designed to be called only once, and it could be more intuitive
to call it within the initialize function rather than as a separate transaction.

**Recommendation:**

Consider revising the function to enhance clarity and align its behavior with the intended
usage of the contract. Additionally, ensure that comments or documentation are provided to
clarify the intended usage and the role of the caller. This will help improve readability and
reduce the risk of misinterpretation by developers interacting with the contract.
