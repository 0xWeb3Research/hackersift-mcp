# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Solidity version update

**Description**

Issue is classified as Medium, because it is included to the list of standard smart contractsâ€™
vulnerabilities. Currently used version (0.8.0) is not the last in the line, so it contradicts
standard checklist.

**Recommendation**:

You need to update the solidity version to the latest one in the branch - consider 0.8.4.


## Low Risk

### Methods should be declared as external

**Description**

VestingScedule.sol:
addVestingSchedule(), claim(), cancel(), getTokenAddress(), getTotalAllocation(),
getTotalClaimedAllocation(), getVestingSchedule()

**Recommendation**:

Declare methods as external.

### SafeMath can be removed

**Description**

Since the contract has 0.8 version of Solidity, SafeMath library can be removed, as overflow
and underflow errors are built-in. Removing the library will give gas savings by omitting extra
function calls.

**Recommendation**:

Omit SafeMath library.
