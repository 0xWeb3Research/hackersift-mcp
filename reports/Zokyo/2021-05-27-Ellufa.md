# Findings

## High Risk

### Accuracy loss in calculations

**Description**

Incorrect order of operations lead to the accuracy losses and incorrect calculations. First of all
- incorrect order of operations: division by total shares amount has to be provided after the
multiplication. And the second problem - instead of fee calculation and subtraction from the
total amount the contract provides two sets of calculations.
performs a multiplication on the result of a division:
initDeposit(), line 362, line 366
company_fee = _amount.div(100).mul(10)
token_fee = _amount.div(100).mul(token_share)
addPayout(address,uint256), line 421, line 423
_profit = amount.div(100).mul(80)
_staked = amount.div(100).mul(20)
withdraw(uint256), line 462, line 463
tc.safeTransfer(msg.sender,_amount.div(100).mul(95))
tc.safeTransfer(companyaddress,_amount.div(100).mul(5))
investStaking(uint16,uint256), line 883
_roi_amount = _amount.div(10000).mul(stakingduration[_nodays].roi_return)

**Recommendation**:
1) Use correct order of calculations: amount.mul(share).div(totalShare)
2) Use mul().div() calculations to get the fee amount and use subtraction to get another
amount.

### Unsafe operations

**Description**
There are a lot of unsafe “+” and “+=” operations. Consider SafeMath usage or Solidity 0.8.6

**Recommendation**:
Use SafeMath for all places where “+” and “+=” operation is used.

## Medium Risk

### Solidity version update

**Description**
The solidity version should be updated. Throughout the project (including interfaces).
Issue is classified as Medium, because it is included to the list of standard smart contracts’
vulnerabilities. Currently used version (0.5.16) is classified as outdated

**Recommendation**:
You need to update the solidity version to the latest one - at least to 0.6.12, though 0.7.6 or
0.8.6 will be the best option. This will help to get rid of bugs in the older versions.


### Error in condition

**Description**
updateTokenShares(uint8), line 615
Condition “_value >= 0” contains a mistake - it should be “_value > 0”, because uint8 is an
unsigned type and the purpose of the condition is to prevent 0 amount transactions.
**Recommendation**:
Correct the condition.

### Unused field in Package

**Description**
Field “status” of package structure is unused. In order to decrease storage usage is better to
remove it and replace mapping for Packages to mapping for maxPayout numbers.
**Recommendation**:
Remove Package structure and use mapping(uint=>uint) to track max payouts.

### No way to remove the merchant

**Description**
Merchants (from merchants mapping) can be added, but there is no functionality to remove
merchant status.
**Recommendation**:
Confirm, that merchant disabling is impossible or add removal method.

### Too complex irrevertible construction

**Description**

Field “leader_status” of User structure can have only 2 values. In order to save storage and gas
usage, consider usage of mapping leader_status with address to bool connection. Also,
setting user as a leader is irrevertible. Consider changing the method
“setLeaderAddress(address)” to “toggleLeaderAddress(address)” where the status can be
unset.

**Recommendation**:

Simplify the construction and consider usage of toggle-like method for leader setting.


## Low Risk

### Methods should be declared as externa

**Description**
In order to get gas saving and make code more secure next functions should be set as
external.
addPackage(uint256,uint8)
addLeaderAddress(address)
addELFTAddress(address)
addExchangeAddress(address)
debitStaking(address,uint256)
creditPayout(address,uint256)
addTokenPrice(uint256)
updateTokenShares(uint8)
enablePhase2()
burnContract(address)
addStakingDuration(uint16,uint16)
investStaking(uint16,uint256)
claimStaking(address)
addStakingContract(address)

**Recommendation**:
Set methods as external.

### Constructor parameters

**Description**
Constructor contains hardcoded addresses from testnet. To avoid any possible mistake it is
better to add parameters to the constructor and a migration script with correct values (for
BSC main and BSC test).

**Recommendation**:
Move hardcoded addresses to the constructor’s parameters.

### Unnecessary require

**Description**
withdraw(), line 450
Require statement for “profitpayout >= min_withdrawal” is extra and can be removed.
**Recommendation**:
Remove extra “require”.

### Unused parameters

**Description**
Parameters elft_address and token_transfer_status are not used in the contract except their
setter. Confirm that these parameters are necessary for the contract or remove them.

**Recommendation**:
Confirm that these parameters are necessary for the contract or remove them.

### Move storage parameters to constants

**Description**
Parameters multiplier and min_withdrawal are set once in the constructor and cannot be
changed. It is recommended to move them to public constants to reduce gas usage.
**Recommendation**:
Move public variables to constants.

### Connected pair of parameters (phaseversion and tokendebit)

**Description**
Parameters phaseversion and tokendebit are set together in constructor and can be changed
only together in enablePhase2() method. There is no way to change them separately, and
these two parameters can have only 2 possible values (identical to each other). Consider
removing one of the storage variables and change another one to the bool flag (e.g. isPhase1)
or to the enum (PHASE1, PHASE2). Such a change will reduce gas usage and increase the
stability of the code.

**Recommendation**:

Remove one of the pair, change another to bool flag or enum.

### Connected pair of parameters (staking_status and merchant_statusParameters

**Description**
staking_status and merchant_status are set together in constructor and can be changed only
together in enablePhase2() and burnContract() methods. There is no way to change them
separately, and these two parameters can have only 2 possible values (identical to each other).
Consider removing one of the storage variables and change another one to the bool flag (e.g.
paymentsEnabled) or to the enum (ENABLED, DISABLED). Such a change will reduce gas usage
and increase the stability of the code.

**Recommendation**:

Remove one of the pair, change another to bool flag or enum.

### Connected pair of parameters (depositStatus and withdrawStatus)

**Description**
Parameters depositStatus and withdrawStatus are set together in constructor and can be
changed only together in burnContract() methods. There is no way to change them
separately, and these two parameters can have only 2 possible values (identical to each other).
Consider removing one of the storage variables and change another one to the bool flag (e.g.
operationsEnabled) or to the enum (ENABLED, DISABLED). Such a change will reduce gas
usage and increase the stability of the code.

**Recommendation**:
Remove one of the pair, change another to bool flag or enum.

### Optimize gas usage

**Description**
Calculations can be simplified by omitting extra calculations for gas savings. Already existing
calculations can be re-used.
addPayout(address,uint256), line 440: PayoutEvent() arguments can be re-used instead of
being recalculated.
withdraw(uint256), line 473, WithdrawEvent() arguments can be re-used instead of being
recalculated.

**Recommendation**:

Re-use existing variables instead of recalculations.

## Informational

### Magic numbers

**Description**
To increase the readability of the code it is recommended to avoid undocumented numbers
hardcoded in the contract.
See it in:
initDeposit(), line 362, line 366
addPayout(address,uint256), line 421, line 423
withdraw(uint256), line 462, line 463
investStaking(uint16,uint256), line 883
These numbers are mostly used for fees calculations. Consider moving them to constants.

**Recommendation**:

Move undocumented numbers to constants.

### Typo in the structure field

**Description**
Struct User { uint256 total_pahse1_stake; total_withdrawl;} should be corrected to
total_phase1_stake and total_withdrawal.

**Recommendation**:
Correct the typo.

### Overpowered role

**Description**
Owner of the contract has all the privileges for setting up core parameters of the contract.
Though there is no way to change the owner or delegate part of the privileges.

**Recommendation**:
Confirm, that owner changing functionality is intentional, or consider usage of standard
Ownable contract or Roles contract from OpenZeppelin library.
