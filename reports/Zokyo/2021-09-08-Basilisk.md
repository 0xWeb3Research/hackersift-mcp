# Findings

## High Risk

### Extrinsic with multiple storage mutations isn’t annotated with #[transactional]

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/duster/src/lib.rs:197
Basilisk-node/pallets/nft/src/lib.rs:84,107
Not using #[transactional] can lead to storage corruption.


**Recommendation**:

Use #[transactional] for every extrinsic with more than one storage mutation.

### Permission in method description doesn't match implementation

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/lbp/src/lib.rs:516-568
Dispatch origin restrictions described in comments must match method implementation

**Recommendation**:

Make sure dispatch origin checks are consistent with method description.

## Medium Risk

### Genesis config checks

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/asset-registry/src/lib.rs:94-98
Absence of genesis config consistency can lead to storage corruption in case when a mistake
was made in genesis config.

**Recommendation**:

Use assert!() to check that CoreAssetId, NextAssetId, AssetIds are consistent.

### Integer overflow/underflow

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/exchange/src/lib.rs:620
Basilisk-node/pallets/lbp/src/lib.rs:746,819,824
Basilisk-node/pallets/nft/src/lib.rs:98
Basilisk-node/pallets/transaction-multi-payment/src/lib.rs:367
Basilisk-node/pallets/xyk/src/lib.rs:629,752
Basilisk-node/primitives/src/lib.rs:126,132
HydraDX-math/src/lbp/lbp.rs:59,60,113
HydraDX-math/src/p12.rs:22,26,50,54,64,102
HydraDX-math/src/transcendental.rs:14,30,39,81,101
Not using safe math can lead to potential bugs.

**Recommendation**:

Use safe functions like checked_add() and checked_sub() for math operations.

## Low Risk

### Panic in runtime (affect further development)

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/asset-registry/src/lib.rs:107
Basilisk-node/pallets/exchange/src/lib.rs:606,615,637,647
Basilisk-node/pallets/exchange/src/direct.rs:101,102,234
Basilisk-node/runtime/src/lib.rs:1107,1114,1034
HydraDX-math/src/lbp/lbp.rs:47,58,59
HydraDX-math/src/transcendental.rs:64
Usage of unwrap() or expect() functions can lead to panic.
Extrinsics must not cause a panic in the runtime logic or else the system becomes vulnerable
to attacks where users can trigger computational execution without any punishment.

**Recommendation**:

Use unwrap_or(), unwrap_or_else() to provide default values or define an error in Error enum
and return it explicitly when there is an error in a Result.

**Client Comment**

The client has handled or verified every case of possible panic in runtime.

**Post-audit**:

Based on the client’s verification the issue is marked as low. Though since the core reason
itself is not fixed, issue is left as unresolved, since it can influence the further development.

### Error handling

**Occurs**:
Basilisk-node/pallets/duster/src/lib.rs:221

When dusting an account error from dec_providers() isn`t handled. This can lead to a
situation when account has at least one consumer and one provider. In this situation provider
counter cannot be decreased and as a result dusted account will still remain alive and
subsequent dusting attempt will fail because account balance is zero.

**Recommendation**:

Revert if dec_providers() returns error.

## Informational

### Naming

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/pallets/lbp/src/lib.rs:778
Misleading method names can lead to errors during further development.

**Recommendation**:

Use names that reflect method implementation.

### Memory allocation

**Occurs**:

Basilisk-node/primitives/src/asset.rs:54
Basilisk-node/pallets/xyk/src/lib.rs:517
Basilisk-node/runtime/src/lib.rs:1032
Extending a vector can lead to reallocation of memory and influence performance.

**Recommendation**:

Use Vec::with_capacity() to create a vector with enough capacity to store all required data.
