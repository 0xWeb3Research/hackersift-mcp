# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Function only returns 'true'.

**Description**

ReferralRegistry.sol: function __isReferredAddress().
FNDZController.sol: isDenominationAssetApproved().
Function returns only 'true' value and not in all cases. Function should return values every
time.

**Recommendation**:

Make sure to return value every time.


## Low Risk

### Iteration through array can consume great amount of gas.

**Description**

ReferralRegistry.sol: migrateReferral().
FNDZController.sol: getIndex().
Iteration through array can consume a lot of gas. In case array has too many elements,
iteration can consume more gas,
than can fit in a single block.

**Recommendation**:

Verify that function execution is optimized, and won't revert due to 'out of gas' error.

## Informational


### Accessor has too much rights.

**Description**

VaultLib.sol: approveAssetSpender(), withdrawAssetTo(), swapAndWithdrawAssetTo(),
mintShares(), burnShares(),
transferShares().
Accessor is able to grant allowance to any address, withdraw assets to any address, swap
assets to any address, etc.
Although, accessor is supposed to be a contract ComptrollerLib.sol, this contract is an
upgrable proxy, which means that
owner can have direct access to users' funds.

**Recommendation**:

Validate that the owner cannot withdraw all funds to himself at any time.
Post-audit:
The issue is added to the document as fact of the "admin backdoor" implementation. Thus this
means, that in case id accessor key is compromised, than all users become vulnerable. Also,
this fact was included to the report as a documented backdoor in order to give information to
the users of the protocol.
After the consultation with the FNDZ team auditors has verified, that by the design of
Protocol, the accessor can only ever be the ComptrollerLib smart contract. So if the
ComptrollerLib's logic is correct, there is no risk to the users' investments.
Is the concern that the FNDZ Admin team could tamper with the ComptrollerLib to introduce a
backdoor that would compromise the users' investments, FNDZ team has presented the
migration process:
1. a new version of the ComptrollerLib is written that allows the FNDZ Admin address to drain
the vault.
2. The new ComptrollerLib is deployed, and vault managers are told to migrate their vaults to
the new ComptrollerLib.
3. The vaults are migrated by the vault owners, and the FNDZ Admin exploits the backdoor to
drain the vaults.
So, the vault owner is the only one who can call `signalMigration` and `executeMigration`,
unless they have delegated the migrator role to FNDZ.

### Function is not restricted.

**Description**

FNDZController.sol: createNewFund().
FundDeployer.sol: createMigratedFundConfig(), cancelMigration(),
cancelMigrationEmergency(), executeMigration(),
executeMigrationEmergency().

**Recommendation**:

Verify that functions should not be restricted.

### ToDo in code

**Description**

Dispatcher.sol: cancelMigration().
Pre-production contracts should not contain unfinished logic.

**Recommendation**:

Verify to implement all the logic.

### Outdated Solidity version.

**Description**

Currently the protocol utilizes Solidity version 0.6.12. It works well, though the general
auditors security checklist recommends to utilize the newest stable version of Solidity which is
0.8.11. The newest version of Solidity includes last optimization for the compiler, last bugfixes
and last features such as built-in overflow and underflow validations.

**Recommendation**:

Update Solidity version to the latest version 0.8.11.
