# Findings

## High Risk

### Check that createLGEWhitelist is called only once {in case createLGEWhitelist is supposed to be called once}

**Description**

In case a whitelist is supposed to be initialized only one time, it is necessary to restrict calling
createLGEWhitelist more than once.
Also, the problem is that this function can be called in the middle of the round, because there
are no restrictions for it. Thus it can break current purchases calculations.

**Recommendation**:

Confirm current functionality or make a boolean variable to control the whitelist creation. Or
add a “require” statement, which will check that the length of the _lgeWhitelistRounds is equal
to zero before executing the function.

### Refresh _lgeTimeStamp {in case createLGEWhitelist is supposed to be called more, than once}

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 397, createLGEWhitelist function
_lgeTimeStamp should be set to zero, so that next time tokens are sent to _lgetPairAddress,
_lgeTimeStamp would be reassigned in _applyLGEWhitelist function.

**Recommendation**:

Assign _lgeTimeStamp to 0 every time round are refreshed inside createLGEWhitelist.

## Medium Risk

### Solidity version update

**Description**

The solidity version should be updated. Throughout the project (including interfaces).
Issue is classified as Medium, because it is included to the list of standard smart contracts’
vulnerabilities. Currently used version (0.5.16) is considered obsolete, which contradicts the
standard checklist.

**Recommendation**:

You need to update the solidity version to the latest one in the branch - consider 0.6.12 or
0.7.6 or 0.8.4.

### Max amount may exceed totalSupply

**Description**

Although these functions can be called only by an authorized person, the total of
maxAmounts should be calculated in order not to exceed totalSupply or balance of
_lgePairAddress .
Also notice, that max amount for each round is a limit for each recipient, but not a total limit
for a whole round. Consider adding more checks.

**Recommendation**:

Add an internal function which calculates sum of max amounts and reverts if total is
exceeded. Call this function in both createLGEWhitelist and modifyLGEWhitelist functions after
setting new values to amountsMax.

## Low Risk

### Pair address zero check

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 392, createLGEWhitelist function
Missing “require” statement for comparison “pairAddress” function parameter with zero
address. It is needed to prevent misleading transactions or a transaction with incorrect
arguments (e.g. because of frontend validation failure).

**Recommendation**:

Add “require” statement before executing function.

### Not restricted round start

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 476, _applyLGEWhiteList
For now anyone can start the purchases rounds (send tokens to _lgePairAddress, thus
triggering _applyLGEWhiteList ).

**Recommendation**:

Confirm the functionality or consider restricting for owner/whitelister only.

### Shadowed variables

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.allowance():
owner (BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol#587) shadows:
Ownable.owner() (BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol#297-299) (function)
BEP20TokenWhitelisted._approve():
owner (BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol#695) shadows:
Ownable.owner() (BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol#297-299) (function)

**Recommendation**:

Rename shadowed variable.

## Informational

### Check sender and recipient addresses

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 671, _transfer function
Missing checking that sender and recipient addresses are not equal in order to prevent
unnecessary gas spending and misleading transactions.

**Recommendation**:

Add “require” statement.

### Use storage pointer

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 417 “modifyLGEWhitelist” function
There are too many usages for _lgeWhitelistRounds[index]. In order to provide gas savings
during the operation, consider usage of storage pointer.

**Recommendation**:

Use storage pointer instead.

### Missing zero address check

**Description**

BEP20TokenWhitelisted.sol, line 428 “modifyLGEWhitelist” function
Missing checking addresses from “addresses” array parameter.

**Recommendation**:

Add “require” statement in for-loop and check every address in the array.
