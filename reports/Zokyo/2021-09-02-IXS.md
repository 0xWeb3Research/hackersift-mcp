## Low Risk

### Correcting the require statements to be more precise

**Description**

Since the transactions would fail if the require condition is not satisfied, So it is recommended
to add a statement which justifies the reason for failing of the transaction.

**Recommendation**:

1) In IXSVestedDistribution.sol file, in constructor(), replace
require(_owner != address(0), "IxsStakeBank: INVALID_OWNER")
with
require(_owner != address(0), "IXSVestedDistribution: INVALID_OWNER")
2) In IxsReturningStakeBank.sol, in stakeFor(), replace
require(MintableBurnableIERC20(returnToken).mint(user, amount), 'IxsStakeBank: MINT_FAILED')
with
require(MintableBurnableIERC20(returnToken).mint(user, amount), IxsReturningStakeBank:
MINT_FAILED')

### Lock pragma to specific version

**Description**

In IxsToken.sol file, lock the pragma to a specific version, since not all the EVM compiler
versions support all the features, especially the latest oneâ€™s which are kind of beta versions, So
the intended behaviour written in code might not be executed as expected.
Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for
example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.
