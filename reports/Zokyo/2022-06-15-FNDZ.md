# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Potential reentrancy attack to claim rewards multiple times. 

**Description**

FNDZStaking.sol: function _ claim RewardsAsFNDZ(). 
Function performs swap of rewards to FNDZ token with swap routes which are passed by user. Since, anyone can create a pair on Uniswap factory, a path with malicious token might be passed, which is why all all storage variables should be changed before external calls.Currently, stakeHolder info "stakeUpdatedAt" and "hasEarned Rewards" are updated after the call. In case, a malicous token is used in a swap route with reentrancy to claiming rewards, "stakeUpdatedAt" should be already updated, so that user doesn't claim rewards multiple times. 

**Recommendation**: 

Update stakeHolderInfo (Currently on lines 483, 484) before the loop (Before line 462).

### Function only returns 'true'. 

**Description**

ReferralRegistry.sol: function _isReferredAddress(). 
FNDZController.sol: isDenomination Asset Approved(). 
Function returns only 'true' value and not in all cases. Function should return values every time. 

**Recommendation**: 

Make sure to return value every time.

## Low Risk

### Reward tokens without a direct pair with FNDZ in swap protocol cannot be withdrawn as FNDZ.

**Description**

InlineSwapMixin.sol: function _inlineSwapAsset(). 
Function_inlineSwapAsset() is used by FNDZStaking for swapping reward tokens to FNDZ(FNDZStaking.sol: line 473). Function creates a swap route with direct pair only(Reward token â†’ FNDZ), however, it is possible that there won't be a direct pair and swap will revert, canceling the withdrawal of reward in FNDZ. Issue is marked as low, because it is still possible to withdraw rewards directly without swapping them into FNDZ, or only reward tokens with direct swap pair might be used. 

**Recommendation**: 

One of the solutions would be to allow users to path swap routes. Another solution is to store swap routes for tokens in storage and create a setter for admin to set optimal swap routes in advance. 

**Post-audit**: 

It is possible to path swap routes to function now. This way, tokens without direct pair with FNDZ can be swapped.


### Iteration through array can consume great amount of gas. 

**Description**

Referral Registry.sol: migrateReferral(). 
FNDZController.sol: getIndex(). 
Iteration through array can consume a lot of gas. In case array has too many elements, 
iteration can consume more gas, 
than can fit in a single block. 

**Recommendation**: 

Verify that function execution is optimized, and won't revert due to 'out of gas' error.

## Informational

### Wrong index is verified. 

**Description**

FNDZStaking.sol: function remove Tracked Assets(), line 120. 
Statement verifies that the found positional index of token to remove is the last. Currently a variable "i" is verified, which is a positional index of array "_assets", not "trackedAssets". A variable "j" should be verified here instead of "i". 

**Recommendation**: 

Verify variable "j" instead of "i".

### Function is not restricted. 

**Description**

FNDZController.sol: createNewFund(). 
FundDeployer.sol: createMigrated FundConfig(), cancel Migration(), 
cancelMigration Emergency(), execute Migration(), 
execute Migration Emergency(). 

**Recommendation**: 

Verify that functions should not be restricted.

### ToDo in code 

**Description**

Dispatcher.sol: cancelMigration(). 
Pre-production contracts should not contain unfinished logic. 

**Recommendation**: 

Verify to implement all the logic.

### Outdated Solidity version. 

**Description**

Currently the protocol utilizes Solidity version 0.6.12. It works well, though the general auditors security checklist recommends to utilize the newest stable version of Solidity which is 0.8.11. The newest version of Solidity includes last optimization for the compiler, last bugfixes and last features such as built-in overflow and underflow validations. 

**Recommendation**: 

Update Solidity version to the latest version 0.8.11.
