# Findings

## High Risk

### CrownyVesting changeVestingAddress function doesn’t transfer claimed tokens

**Description**

In a case when transferring a vesting which is already partly claimed, the new address is able
to claim this partly claimed amount once more as a consequence of this issue. This double
claim can also cause an insufficient amount of vested tokens to pay all vestings in a contract
(invariant that is held otherwise in a contract).

**Recommendation**:

Add transferring of __claimed value to a new address in change VestingAddress function of
CrownyVesting contract.

## Medium Risk

### CrownyVesting allowedToClaim can in some cases return a value that is bigger than the full vesting amount

**Description**


In a case, if initialClaim + vestingIncrement * penultimateJunctureIndex value is higher than a full
vesting amount, allowedToClaim function can return a value that is bigger than a full vesting
amount consequently allowing to claim amount higher than expected. The risk of this issue
isn’t higher because the owner of the contract can make sure that the value would actually be
in range but it’s better to additionally safeguard from this problem.

**Recommendation**:

Add restriction on allowedToClaim return value to not be bigger than vestingAmount - claimed
or additionally validate values in the setVesting method.

## Low Risk

### CrownyVesting __getJunctureIndex contains a loop with an unrestricted amount of iterations

**Description**

__getJunctureIndex function contains an iteration through junctures and there aren’t any
restrictions on the length of junctures so the gas consumption of this function can be hard to
predict. The loop doesn’t contain any gas-heavy logic so the priority of this issue isn’t high.

**Recommendation**:

Restrict a maximum number of junctures to make maximum gas cost or rework a logic and
remove the loop altogether.

## Informational

### CrownyToken can be inherited from more Openzeppelin token contracts

**Description**

Amount of custom logic in CrownyToken contract can be reduced by inheriting from
ERC20Capped and ERC20Pausable token contracts provided by the Openzeppelin contracts
library. Relying on a library token contract code as much as possible is generally a good
practice.

**Recommendation**:

Inherit CrownyToken from ERC20Capped and ERC20Pausable and remove custom logic
provided by them from CrownyToken contract.

### CrownyVesting state variable mappings can be grouped as a one mapping to a struct

**Description**

CrownyVesting contract contains a bunch of state variable mappings(__junctures, __vesters, ...)
that can be represented as a mapping from an address to a struct containing values of those
mappings as fields. This can make code more readable and less error-prone.

**Recommendation**:

Group CrownyVesting individual mappings as one mapping to a struct.

**Re-audit**:

Mappings are aggregated but the readability can still be improved by storing a
__vestingSchedules[_beneficiary] in a local variable when multiple accesses are made to it. For
example, instead of:
```solidity
uint256 maximumClaimable = __vestingSchedules[_beneficiary].vestingAmount -
__vestingSchedules[_beneficiary].claimed;
```
The code would look like this:
```solidity
VestingSchedule storage currentVesting = __vestingSchedules[_beneficiary];
uint256 maximumClaimable = currentVesting.vestingAmount - currentVesting.claimed;
```
