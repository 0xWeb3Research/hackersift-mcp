# Findings

## Low Risk

### Additional check is required for the constructor of QUAD.sol

**Description**

There is no verification for array length.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for arrays length:
require(
wallets.length == amounts.length,
"QUAD: wallets and amounts mismatch"
);

### Additional check is required at TokenVesting.sol

**Description**

In function releaseVestedTokens() there is no verification for the zero address of the recipient.

**Recommendation**:

Add an additional check.

## Informational

### Order of Functions

**Description**

The functions in contract TokenVesting and MultiSigWallet are not grouped according to their
visibility and order.
Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following way:
Constructor;
Receive function (if exists);
Fallback function (if exists);
External;
Public;
Internal;
Private.
Ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and find the constructor and
fallback definitions easier.

**Recommendation**:

Consider changing functions order according to solidity documentation: . Order of Functions

### Order of Layout

**Description**


Layout contract elements in TokenVesting and MultiSigWallet contracts are not logically
grouped.
The contract elements should be grouped and ordered in the following way:
Pragma statements;
Import statements;
Interfaces;
Libraries;
Contract.
Inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:
Library declarations (using statements);
Constant variables;
Type declarations;
State variables;
Events;
Modifiers;
Functions.
token contract is not set to Bond & Unbond contracts
Ordering helps readers to navigate the code and find the elements more quickly.

**Recommendation**:

Consider changing the order of layout according to solidity documentation: . Order of Layout

### Unnecessary check at TokenVesting.sol

**Description**


In function addRecipient (at line 114) and function addRecipientBatch (at line 170) of
TokenVesting.sol you have check for parameter _startTime:
startTime: _startTime == 0 ? block.timestamp : _startTime,
But you already checked this parameter in lines 108, 109 (for function addRecipient) and in
lines 157,158 (for function addRecipientBatch) according to them it should be greater than
zero so it will always return false and will use _startTime.

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary check:
startTime: _startTime,

### Unnecessary require at MultiSigWallet.sol

**Description**

In the function tryInsertSequenceId() you require onlySigner. This function is private and can be
called only with functions that already have this requirement.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the unnecessary requirements.
