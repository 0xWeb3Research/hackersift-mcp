# Findings

## Informational

### Unnecessary multiplication.

**Description**

Lines 26, minting function utilizes multiplication by 1 ether, though direct literal usage is
allowed. Removing extra operation saves a bit of gas.

**Recommendation**:

Multiplication can be removed

### Utilize constant

**Description**

Lines 26, number of tokens minted may be moved to the public constant instead of
constructing a variable - such a move will save a bit of gas during deployment.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of the public constant.

### Shadowed variable

**Description**

In constructor, local variable “owner” shadows the call for the owner() function of the Ownable
contract.

**Recommendation**:

Consider renaming (for example to _owner).
