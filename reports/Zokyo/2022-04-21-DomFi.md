# Findings

## Low Risk

### In contract StakingRewards for match calculations it is used the SafeMath library, this is a good practice if the contracts are compile in a version of solidity lower then 0.8, but however the current contracts are compile with 0.8.6 or bigger so there is no need to use SafeMath, it will only make the bytecod larger with no added benefit.

**Recommendation**:

Remove the use us SafeMath library and make the calculations without it.

### In contract L2DominationToken, at line 12 variable l1Token_ is declared private and then at line 13 it’s value is returned using an external function, there is no need to do that, it can be simply declared public, it will automatically generate a public getter and private setter for it’s value.

**Recommendation**:
Delete the function from line 13 and then make the variable l1Token_ from line 12 from
private to public and also change it’s name to l1Token.

## Informational

### In solidity all strings are defined on 32 bytes, so there is not benefit if your string message from the require functions have less then 32 bytes, but there is an additional gas cost if it have more bytes then 32, in contract StakingRewardsFactory, all the string messages from the require functions have more then 32 bytes.

**Recommendation**:

Make all the string messages from the require functions in contract StakingRewardsFactory
no bigger then 32 bytes to save up gas.

### Contract StakingRewards does not respect best practices in terms of functions and variables declaration orders, there is a mix between single variables and mappers plus a mix between external and public functions and the events are declared at the final lines.

**Recommendation**:

Be sure to first declare all the variables first, mappers and events after, then the constructor/
initializer, then the functions in the following order, external, public, internals.

### Contract L2DominationToken does not respect best practices in terms of functions and variables declaration orders, there should not be an external function between the variable declaration and the modifiers.

**Recommendation**:

Be sure to first declare all the variables first, mappers and events after, then the constructor/
initializer, then the functions in the following order, external, public, internals.

### In contract StakingRewards, line 71, is over 120 chars, based on best practices a line should not have over 120 chars.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor the line from 125 chars to a maximum of 120 chars.

### In contract StakingRewardsFactory, line 44, is over 120 chars, based on best practices a line should not have over 120 chars.

**Recommendation**:

Refactor the line from 127 chars to a maximum of 120 chars.
