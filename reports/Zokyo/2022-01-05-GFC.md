# Findings

## Low Risk

### Smart contracts are not completely covered by NatSpec annotations. https:// docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/style-guide.html

## Informational

### The fields of VestingObj struct in TokenTimeLock.sol can further be rearranged and to reduce gas cost and storage requirement. The size of these fields can be optimized.

Uint256 releaseTime can be optimized to uint64,
Uint256 amount can be optimized to uin128 amount
Ths: {
Bool redeemed;
Address beneficiary;
Uint64 releaseTime;
Uint128 amount;
}

### Specifying a pragma version with the caret symbol (^) upfront which tells the compiler to use any version of solidity bigger than specified considered not a good practice. Since there could be major changes between versions that would make your code unstable. The latest known versions with bugs are 0.8.8

**Recommendation**:

set the latest version without the caret. (The latest version that is also known as bug-free is
0.8.11.)
