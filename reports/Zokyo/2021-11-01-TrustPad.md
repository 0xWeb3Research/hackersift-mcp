# Findings

## High Risk

### The contract WithPools.sol is not compiled

**Description**

In the WithPools.sol contract, the types for comparison do not match in the poolExists function
at line 51, because pools is an array of type IStakingLockableExternal, and the pool is a regular
address.

**Recommendation**:

Make a pool of type IStakingLockableExternal, example:
if(pools[i] == IStakingLockableExternal(pool))

**Re-audit**:

Skipped.

## Low Risk

### Unreachable code

**Description**

In Steakable.sol file, in deposit(), the if(user.amount==0) will never get satisfied because the
minimum value that will get updated in the user.amount variable before is Non-zero value.

**Recommendation**:

Do user.amount calculations unconditionally amount > 0, then stakersNumber will be
increasing.

**Re-audit**:

Skipped.

### Unreachable code

**Description**

In Steakable.sol file, in withdraw(), the if(user.amount == 0 && stakersNumber > 0) will never get
satisfied because stackersNumber will not be added when deposited.

**Recommendation**:

Fix issue in function deposit() for increase stakersNumber.

**Re-audit**:

Skipped.

### Lock pragma to a specific version

**Description**

Lock the pragma to a specific version, since not all the EVM compiler versions support all the
features, especially the latest oneâ€™s which are kind of beta versions, So the intended behavior
written in code might not be executed as expected.
Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for
example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.

**Re-audit**:

Resolved.

### Few checks in the required statements and suggestions

**Description**

1) In withPools.sol file, in addPool() check can be made to make sure that the pool is not
added already;
2) In withPools.sol file, in setPoolMultiplier(), check whether the pool is present before
updating the multiplier attribute;
3) In Claimer.sol file, in withdrawAll(), before 188 line check whether token is not zero, that is:
require(address(token) != address(0), "Claimer: token address is not present")
4) In LaunchPad.sol, in internalBuyTokens() function, move the line:
equire(amount > 0, "Sale: amount is 0");
before the line 85, that is before updating the tokenSold variable;
5) In LevelManager.sol, in getUserAmount(), in line 45, check the amount is whether a valid
number or not before doing the calculation;
6) In withdrawable.sol, in withdrawBalance() & withdrawToken() functions, check should be
made before withdrawing the amount, that is required:
(amount >0, "Withdrawable: Amount should be greater than zero")
7) In Stakeable.sol, in updatePool() function, in line 80, no need of if condition because it will
never get satisfied except when:
blocknumber=liquidityMining.lastRewardBlock
8) Use math.sol for all arithmetic operations wherever possible.

**Re audit**:

Resolved.
