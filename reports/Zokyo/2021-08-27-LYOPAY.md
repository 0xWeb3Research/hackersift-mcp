# Findings

## High Risk

### The contract owner has too many permissions

**Description**

Contract owners can add any address to the blacklist with function addBlacklist() and burn user
tokens with function destroyBlackFunds() without user allowance.

**Recommendation**:

Burn user tokens only when it’s allowed by user or share additional information why this
function needs to be included.

### The contract owner can set any fee

**Description**

Function updateMaxFee() allows the owner of the contract to set any value for the fee amount
even greater than the 100%.

**Recommendation**:

You can add a constant variable for max fee and verify that this condition is met in function
updateMaxFee().

## Low Risk

### Additional check is required for function addBlacklist()

**Description**

There is no verification for the zero address for the blacklist address.

**Recommendation**:

Add additional check:
require(_blackListAddress != address(0), "Wrong address");

### Additional check is required for function _transfer()

**Description**

There is no verification for current balance comparatively to the sending amount.

**Recommendation**:

Add additional check:
require(
balanceOf[_from] >= _value,
"Insufficient balance"
);

## Informational

### Confusing revert message

**Description**

In function _transfer() if the sender is in black blacklist and tries to send tokens, the return
message will be “Your address is blocked from transferring tokens.” same message will be if
recipient is in blacklist.

**Recommendation**:

Change message for black list recipient:
require(
!blackListMap[_to],
"Recipient address is blocked from token transferring."
);
