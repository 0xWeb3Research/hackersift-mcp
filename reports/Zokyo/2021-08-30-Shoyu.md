# Findings

## High Risk

### Wrong permission in NFT if deployed via factory

**Description**

When the function createNFT721 is called msg.sender is the address of X user, and this
address passed as parameter to NFT contract as owner. But msg.sender in NFT721
constructor is the address of the factory, and in the initialize function contract trying to call the
function with onlyOwner modifier. Since msg.sender in initialize is factory and owner is
msg.sender of factory call (in my case user) it fails. This is also relevant for NFT1155.

**Recommendation**:

Change onlyOwner modifier to onlyOwnerOrFactory with changing of require in ti. Or provide
access for factory to execute setRoyaltyFeeRecipient and setRoyaltyFee functions.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed, now factory owner passed by parameter of factory call.

### Exceeding of gas limit

**Description**

Deploying TokenFactory requires 17,158,715 gas, since ethereum mainnet gas limit is 15
million it will be reverted. Theoretically it can be executed because when contracts are
deploying blockchain provides a separate block for each contract with their own limits, but I
can’t prove it with tests (it doesn't work), so I can’t guarantee that it will be deployed. Also on
binance smart chain limit is around 80 millions.

**Recommendation**:

Change TokenFactory constructor to be in the 15 million gas range. Or provide information
about on which network contracts will be deployed.

**Re-audit**:

Fixed, now contract deployment is under 15,000,000 gas.

## Low Risk

### Use OpenZeppelin’s safe math library

**Description**

Since the there are chances of underflow/overflow occurrences during mathematical
operations, it is recommended to use openzeppelin safemath.sol library for all mathematical
operations: openzeppelin-contracts/SafeMath.sol at master ·
OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts (github.com)

**Comment from Shoyu team**:

For openzeppelin SafeMath issue, it doesn’t apply to our case since we use solc 0.8.3.

### Correcting the require statements to be more precise

**Description**

Since the transactions would fail if the require condition is not satisfied, So it is recommended
to add a statement which justifies the reason for failing of the transaction.

**Recommendation**:
1) In ProxyFactory.sol file, in _createProxy() function, replace
require(success, "SHOYU: CALL_FAILURE")
with
require(success, "SHOYU: FAILED TO CALL THE REQUESTED FUNCTION")
2) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in setBaseURI721(), length of the argument string could be
checked to make sure that uri cannot be zero before updating the state.
3) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in setBaseURI1155(), length of the argument string could
be checked to make sure that uri cannot be zero before updating the state.
4) In Tokenfactory.sol file, in setProtocolFeeRecipient(), replace
require(protocolFeeRecipient != address(0), "SHOYU: INVALID_FEE_RECIPIENT")
with
require(protocolFeeRecipient != address(0), "SHOYU: INVALID_PROTOCOL_FEE_RECIPIENT")
5) In Tokenfactory.sol file, in setOperationalFeeRecipient(), replace

require(operationalFee <= MAX_OPERATIONAL_FEE, "SHOYU: OPERATIONAL FEE IS GREATER
THAN THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED OPERATIONAL FEE")
7) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in isNFT721(), check could be made such that the passed
query is not zero before calling the _isProxy() function.
8) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in isNFT1155(), check could be made such that the passed
query is not zero before calling the _isProxy() function.
9) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in createSocialToken(), check whether the arguments
name and symbol strings are Non empty before executing the remaining code.
10) In the Tokenfactory.sol file, in isSocialToken(), check could be made such that the
argument query is not zero before calling the _isProxy() function.
11) In Tokenfactory.sol file, in setTags721(), replace
require(IBaseNFT721(nft).ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "SHOYU: FORBIDDEN")

MORE THAN ZERO")

not own")

require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address")
with
require(to != address(0), "ERC721: to address cannot be zero")
15) In ERC721Initializable.sol, in safeTransferFrom(), replace
require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId), "SHOYU: FORBIDDEN")
with
require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId), "SHOYU: CALLER IS NEITHER OWNER NOR
APPROVED")
16) In BaseNFT721.sol file, in parkTokenIds(), replace
require(owner() == msg.sender, "SHOYU: FORBIDDEN")
with
require(owner() == msg.sender, "SHOYU: CALLER IS NOT THE OWNER")


17) In BaseNFT721.sol file, in mint(), replace

## Informational

### Could make code more efficient

**Description**

In ReentrancyGuardInitializable.sol, on lines 35 & 36, the private variables _NOT_ENTERED &
_ENTERED could be declared as boolean types instead of unit256:
uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;

**Recommendation**:

Replace
uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;

with


bool private constant _NOT_ENTERED =true;
bool private constant _ENTERED =true;
And also change the logic according to the changes made.
