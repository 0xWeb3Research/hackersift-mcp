# Findings

## High Risk

### In contract AMMUtility, there is a dangerous external call to a user-inputted address with a user input calldata, in internal function _swap at line 86, a malicious user could carefully craft an attack here where the _swapTarget variable will have the address of a token that an user would have previously allowed the AMMUtility to spend his balance and the calldata would be the sighash of the transferFrom function with it’s parameter, using this crafter input a malicious actor would be able to steal a user funds of an arbitrary token that has given AMMUtility contract the allowance to use his balance and that is an action that is happening already because the swap function from AMMUtility is already using the transferFrom function.

## Medium Risk

### Contract UnifarmERC20 will not be able to use the relay transactions functionality, even if it’s inheriting BaseRelayRecipient because the trustedForwarder address is never initialized with a value, so it will always have the default value which is the address(0), which means that when the function _msgSender() is called, the condition from line 35 in BaseRelayRecipient will never be true, we noticed that UnifarmPair is inheriting the UnifarmERC20 and there trustedForwarder it is initialized, but if you would use the UnifarmERC20 on it’s own it will not work.

**Recommendation**:

Add a setter for trustedForwarder or initalized it in the constructor.


## Informational

### In contract BaseRelayRecipient in modifier trustedForwarderOnly at line 20, there is a casting from trustedForwarder to address(trustedForwarder) but trustedForwarder is already a variable of type address so the casting is not necessarily.

**Recommendation**:

Eliminate the casting to address as it is not necessary

### In contract MultiSigWallet, there is the modifier called transactionExists which is checking if a transactionId is valid by checking the destination variable and is returning the ERR_INVALID_TARGET, all of this is not very consistent and it’s not in term with best practices for code context consistency.

**Recommendation**:

Either change the modifier name to something similar as ‘onlyValidTarget’ or add an variable
to the transaction structure of type bool called exist which will be false by default and change
the error message in something similar with “ERR_INVALID_TX”

### In contract GovernorBravoDelegator, at line 44 function _setImplementation is declared with an “_” at the beginning of the name, a convention that is specific to the internal functions.

**Recommendation**:

Change the function name to “setImplementation” therefore removing the “_”
