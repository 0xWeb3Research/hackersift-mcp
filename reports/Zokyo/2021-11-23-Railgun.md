# Findings

## Low Risk

### Unsafe transfer usage

**Description**

In contract RailgunLogic.sol in functions transact() and generateDeposit() is used transfer()
function for transferring fee to the treasury contract. Since transfers have fixed 2,300 gas for
executing it is unsafe to use it with new versions of solidity.

**Recommendation**:

Consider to use call() instead of transfer().

**Re-audit**:

Fixed. Replaced transfer() with call().

## Informational

### Misleading NatSpec comment

**Description**

In Commitments.sol contracts for function insertLeaves() provided misleading comments in
lines 138-142. In section @notice and @dev descriptions in not valid for the functionality.

**Recommendation**:

Consider fixing the comment.
