# Findings

## High Risk

### Incorrect values for release times are set in the constructor since there is no binding to the current time, so the user can easily withdraw all funds at once.

**Example Case**:
Three values are transferred to the releaseTime_ array - 100, 1000, 10000 (in seconds). The
current timestamp is 1,000,000 (there are even more on the mainnet). When creating the
VestPeriodInfo structure, we must pass 1000000 + 100 in the releaseTime field, and so on. But
in the code now just 100, 1000 ...
**Example Case**:
Use block.timestamp when creating an object of the VestPeriodInfo structure.

### Low accuracy. After division, loss of accuracy is possible.

**Recommendation**:
Since there are no fractional numbers in solidity, one method is used. We can take any
number as one hundred percent. For example, let's say we have 100% = 10 ^ 27, then 1% = 10
^ 25.
**Example**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c9e84e-d553-4d6f-84dc-339cd11bf9fe)

With this method, the accuracy of the calculations will be much more accurate.


### EmergencyWithdraw must be with onlyOwner modifier.

### There may be a problem that the sum of all percentages can be more than 100% or less than 100%. In the first case, an error will occur, since there will not be enough funds on the contract to pay. In the second case, tokens will remain on the contract, which then will not go anywhere.

Recommendation:
Create a function that will check that the amount of interest is equal to 100%.

## Medium Risk

### The setTotalBalance function is superfluous.

**Recommendation**:
The amount can be passed directly to the ArgoTokenVesting constructor. Then
ArgoTokenVesting does not need to be Ownable and has setTotalBalance method.


### In the constructor “require” is duplicated.

**Recommendation**:
Delete duplicates.

### A lot of reading from the store. Inefficient use of gas.

**Recommendation**:
Copy the structure to a local variable or copy only the most repetitive fields to variables.

### Using + instead of add.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8614db7d-1497-4d9c-b9cf-fbfe56f78704)

**Recommendation**:
Use the add method of the safeMath library, as in theory an overflow is possible.

## Low Risk

### Unused import (5th line).
ARGO.sol

### Variable totalBalance without an access modifier.
**Recommendation**:
You can make an access modifier public for convenience and to increase user trust.

### Now variable _setTotalCalled and function setTotalCalled are not used anywhere and are not needed.

### Since variable _totalBalance is now public, it doesn't need a getter. It is also customary to name public fields of contracts without an underscore.

### Since hardhat / console is no longer used, you need to remove the import.

### The logger is not related to the business logic. If possible, remove it as it increases the cost of the function itself.

**Recommendation**:
If it has no relation to the business logic, it’s better to remove it in order to improve gas
efficiency.

### Incorrect names for variables.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b10be49-e704-4dde-964c-ccd4a6221d55)

**Recommendation**:
Use plural names.

### Reading from the store at each iteration (Line 125). Inefficient use of gas.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07274a71-520d-4c0d-97b0-7baca4ddcf37)

**Recommendation**:
Move the length of the vestPeriodInfoArray array into a local variable.

### Functions are used instead of variables?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a09911-7930-4abc-b394-4e714f86183b)

**Recommendation**:
Uuse variables directly.

### There is an extra word 'Mapping' in the name of the map and it is better to make a plural.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1439c51a-41e6-43eb-a1eb-d17e05ced112)

**Recommendation**:
For example, whiteListedAddressMapping => whiteListedAddresses.

### Lines 50 and 73 have an extra space after the word address.

### The name of the structure is whiteListedAddressInfo with a lowercase letter.
**Recommendation**:
Capitalize the letter.

### Inefficient use of gas. Many calls to the array object.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22e071f5-d87e-4d66-b908-d1263bc53383)

**Recommendation**:
We can store _addressList [i] in a separate variable for optimization.

### SafeTransfer is not used here.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d9ad319-57d6-4062-8d7e-988ce26677fa)

**Recommendation**:
If safeTransfer is not needed here, please delete the library connection.

### Function emergencyWithdraw returns nothing.

**Recommendation**:

Remove returns from the function signature.

### The name of the withdraw function and the corresponding event is incorrect.

**Recommendation**:
Please use more appropriate names such as createVesting and vestingCreated.

### Incorrect name.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bda76cb-5b75-49b3-bad5-27ddf31f77b5)

**Recommendation**:
Use the plural form.

### There is a lot of extra storage in the withdraw function.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa8351ac-d93a-45f3-aaa9-ad92d49c7bbd)

**Recommendation**:
Save the most frequently used variables (or structure) to a local variable.
