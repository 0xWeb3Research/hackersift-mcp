# Findings

## High Risk

### Incorrect Ether transfer

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, unstake() (line 267), notifyRewardAmount() (line 316),
finishPrePurchasersMode() (line 424), _getReward() (line457)
After the Istanbul and Berlin updates, sending Eth with transfer() and send() methods is
forbidden since it may fail during fallback function call because of the not enough forwarded
gas.
Thus, the only correct for m of Eth sending is with the call() method, for example:
(bool success,) = addr.call{value: val}(””);
require(success, “Failed Eth transfer”);

**Recommendation**

Use the call() method for Eth sending.

## Medium Risk

### Missing checks to distinguish staked funds and reward funds

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, unstake(), finishPrePurchasersMode(), _getReward()
The contract operates with the same currency for the rewards and for the user stakes. In spite
of the stakes being tracked within totalSupply variable, there are no checks against that value
during the rewards distribution or transfers to the users.
So, in order to mitigate possible scenarios where (as an effect of the calculations with edge
cases parameters) rewards amount may exceed the actual distributed value (and get the part
of the supplied funds) we recommend to add checks that reward amount does not exceed the
distributed value. So, in order to mitigate possible scenarios where (as an effect of the
calculations with edge cases parameters) rewards amount may exceed the actual distributed
value (and get the part of the supplied funds) we recommend to add checks that reward
amount does not exceed the distributed value.

**Recommendation**:

For the rewards transfers add checks like: rewardToTransfer <=
address(this).balance.sub(totalSupply).

### Missing check for the rewards available

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, finishPrePurchasersMode()
The function relies on the fact that the contract already has rewards distributed. Though there
is no security checks confirming this fact. Thus the contract may calculate amounts to be
returned incorrectly and draw staked amounts from the users.

**Recommendation**:

Consider adding checks for the lastUpdateTime to be greater than 0 (so the rewards are
started).

### Incorrect view value

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, rewardPerShft()
The function should return 0 in case if rewards were not distributed yet - in case if
lastUpdateTime equals 0. This refers to the period when pre-purchasers are added and
rewards are not distributed yet.

**Recommendation**:

Correct the method.

### Function execution reverts.

**Description**

ShyftBlockReward.sol, function setupExData().
In case, sender of transaction is administratorAddress, function performs internal transaction
of its own function(Lines 294-296), which also check, that a sender is administratorAddress.
However, when contract performs this calls, it becomes sender instead of
administratorAddress, which means that functions won’t update storage variables.

**Recommendation**:

Instead of performing internal calls, make functions setExRewardsEnabled(),
setExCallsEnabled() and setExContractAddress() and call them without using “this” object.

## Low Risk

### Missing visibility identifier

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, prePurchasersModeOn (line 87)
ShyftBlockReward.sol: lockExAdministrator, benefactorCoinbase, benefactorDelegate,
delegateOriginalBenefactor, blockSealerHistoryLastBlockSealedMapping,
blockSealerHistoryMapping, blockSealerHistoryArray.
Visibility is missing (private by default), so should be verified for the correct usage of the
storage and access.

**Recommendation**:

Add visibility identifier.

### Missing unbond per index

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, _unbond()
The function misses the unbond with the index 0 - all ids start from the index 1, which is
untraditional and controversial.

**Recommendation**:

Verify the functionality and check of the calculation should start from 0 index.

### Constant can be used

**Description**

ShyftStaking.sol, unbondingPeriod (line 26)
The value is set just once during the initialization and is not changed throughout the contract.
Also there is no setter for the variable. Thus it can be set as the constant or the immutable
variable constructed in the implementation.

**Recommendation**:

Consider using the constant.
