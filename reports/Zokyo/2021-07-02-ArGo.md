# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Unused modifier

**Description**

Contract ArgoPayments.sol has two functions (charge/chargeWithProvider) that use a modifier
whenNotPaused. Functions _pause() in contract Pausable.sol is internal and it’s state by default
is false.

**Recommendation**:

Add new function pause() to the contract ArgoPayments.sol if charge/chargeWithProvider need
to be pausable or remove modifier whenNotPaused and its import.

### Unsafe calculation

**Description**

In contract YieldFarm.sol (argo-yieldfarming-staking-master), in function massHarvest there is
a calculation without safe math check:
totalDistributedValue += _harvest(i);

**Recommendation**:

Add safe math:
totalDistributedValue = totalDistributedValue.add(_harvest(i));

### Unsafe token transfer

**Description**

In contract Staking.sol (argo-yieldfarming-staking-master) there are 4 occurrences of
token.transfer(..) or token.transferFrom(..). Although most tokens will revert (in case something
went wrong), some may simply return false.

**Recommendation**:

Add safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom to cover this situation.

## Low Risk

### Unnecessary SafeMath #1

**Description**

At contract utils/MultiOwnable.sol (argo-payments-contract-master) you can skip
Openzeppelin’s safe math for 2 reasons:
With Solidity >= 0.8.0 you don't need to import the Openzeppelin SafeMath anymore.
Just write a + b and it will automatically revert on overflows.
Managers.length will hit gas limits first.

**Recommendation**:

Remove safe math import and replace .sub with
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
using SafeMath for uint256;

managers[k] = managers[managers.length.sub(1)];
Replace

managers[k] = managers[managers.length - 1];

### Unnecessary require

**Description**

At contract utils/MultiOwnable.sol (argo-payments-contract-master) there modifier onlyOwner
+ require(msg.sender == owner);.

**Recommendation**:

Remove line 42:
require(msg.sender == owner);

### Unnecessary SafeMath #2

**Description**

At contract ArgoPayments.sol (argo-payments-contract-master) you can skip Openzeppelin’s
safe math, because with Solidity >= 0.8.0 you don't need to import the Openzeppelin SafeMath
anymore. Just write a + b and it will automatically revert on overflows.

**Recommendation**:

Remove safe math import and replace .sub .add .div .mul with appropriate math operation (15
occurrences in total).

### _calculateDiscount function could be a little bit more gas efficient

**Description**

The function is in contract ArgoPayments.sol (argo-payments-contract-master), three
modification can save some gas:
Function takes parameter a, then assigns its value to a new variable amount. I believe
function parameter can be simply called amount at the first place.
Loop in the function constantly checks discountSlabs length. It would be better to pre
store it a variable.
Check if discount enabled at the very beginning.

**Recommendation**:

Rebuild function considering these 3 changes and safe math listed above.
```solidity
function _calculateDiscount(address u, uint256 amount) internal view
returns (uint256)
{
if (!discountsEnabled) return 0;
uint256 stake = stakingManager.balanceOf(u, address(underlying));
uint256 percent = 0;
uint256 slabLength = discountSlabs.length;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < slabLength; i++) {
if (stake >= discountSlabs[i].amount) {
percent = discountSlabs[i].percent;
} else {
break;
}
}
return (amount * percent * PRECISION) / PERCENT;//discount
}
```

## Informational

### No SPDX-License-Identifier found in: CommunityVault.sol

**Description**

Trust in smart contracts can be better established if their source code is available. Since
making source code available always touches on legal problems with regards to copyright, the
Solidity compiler encourages the use of machine-readable SPDX license identifiers.

**Recommendation**:

Every source file should start with a comment indicating its license.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
Example:

Re-audit:
Fixed.

### Extra inheritance

**Description**

Contract ArgoPayments.sol (argo-payments-contract-master) is derived from MultiOwnable
and GovernanceOwnable contracts.
At the same time contract GovernanceOwnable is also derived from MultiOwnable.
In this case I believe you can remove MultiOwnable from ArgoPayments.

**Recommendation**:

Remove MultiOwnable import and replace:
contract ArgoPayments is MultiOwnable, Pausable, GovernanceOwnable {

contract ArgoPayments is Pausable, GovernanceOwnable {

### Minor optimization possible

**Description**

Contract Staking.sol (argo-yieldfarming-staking-master) has two very similar functions:
deposit and despitFor. They share more than 100 lines of code that is different only in several
places (diff is msg.sender and userAddress)

**Recommendation**:

it would be nice to have an internal function that handles epoch logic calculation in one place.
So deposit and depositFor simply call the func passing user address. This will decrease
contract size and may be useful if any modifications needed: they have to be done in one
place only.
