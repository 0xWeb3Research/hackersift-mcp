# Findings

## High Risk

### Incorrect assignment of a value to the variable

**Description**

Incorrect assignment of a value to the stargatePerBlock variable in the LPStaking contract
constructor. Among the constructor parameters is the variable _stargatePerBlock. In its
implementation, its value should be assigned to the public variable stargatePerBlock. However,
an error in the name was made during the assignment.

**Recommendation**:

Check the assignment in the constructor and use the correct name when assigning a value to
the stargatePerBlock variable. Example: stargatePerBlock = stargatePerBlock;.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

### Reentrancy attack in emergencyWithdraw function

**Description**


During the manual audit, we found that the emergencyWithdraw function in the contract
LPStaking.sol is prone to reentrancy attack as the contract makes tokens transfer before
updating the user's balance to zero(0). Also, this function also does not make any checks to
see if the status of the contract is in an emergency before it can be called by users to
withdraw tokens.

**Recommendation**:

Enable/disable the emergencyWithdraw function if the contract is in emergency status. Also for
a fix, we suggest reading and assigning users’ balance in a temporal variable, then resetting
the user’s balance to zero(0) before tokens are sent out using the temporal variable as the
sending amount.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

## Low Risk

### Use of multiple for loops in Pool contract

**Description**


The use of multiple for loops in Pool contract has the danger of running into out of gas errors
if they are not kept under control.

**Recommendation**:

This can be avoided by adding a gasleft() < 20000 type of condition that if it returns true it will
break the execution so the out of gas error message will be avoided. Example: if (gasleft() <
20000) break;.

**Re-audit**:
Skipped.

**Re-audit 2**:
Skipped.

## Informational

### Contracts isn’t completely covered by NatSpec annotations

**Description**

Functions are not described and NatSpec annotations are not used.

**Recommendation**:

Add comments to functions in contracts.

**Re-audit**:
Skipped.

**Re-audit 2**:
Add annotations to all functions, including private, internal ones and constructor.

### Order of Functions

**Description**


The functions in contracts Bridge, LPStaking, LPTokenERC20, Pool, and Router are not
grouped according to their visibility and order.
Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following way:
Constructor;
Receive function (if exists);
Fallback function (if exists);
External;
Public;
Internal;
Private.
Ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and find the constructor and
fallback definitions easier.

**Recommendation**:

Consider changing functions order according to solidity documentation: . Order of Functions

**Re-audit**:

Add these changes to contracts LPStaking, LPTokenERC20, and Router.

**Re-audit 2**:

Skipped.

### Comments are different from the implementation

**Description**


Comments in the function swap() of the Pool contract are different from the implementation.

**Recommendation**:

Update comments to function or update implementation.

**Re-audit**:
Skipped.

### Require without explanation

**Description**

Require require(msg.sender == address(layerZeroEndpoint)) in the function lzReceive() of Bridge
contract without comment.

**Recommendation**:
Add comment to require.

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.

**Re-audit**:
Missed because, according to the partner, the function is still under development.


### Order of Layout

**Description**


The layout contract elements in LPStaking, Pool, LPTokenERC20, and Router contracts are not
logically grouped.
The contract elements should be grouped and ordered in the following way:
Pragma statements;
Import statements;
Interfaces;
Libraries;
Contract.
Inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:
Library declarations (using statements);
Constant variables;
Type declarations;
State variables;
Events;
Modifiers;
Functions.
Ordering helps readers to navigate the code and find the elements more quickly.

**Recommendation**:

Consider changing the order of layout according to solidity documentation: . Order of Layout

**Re-audit**:
Fixed.
