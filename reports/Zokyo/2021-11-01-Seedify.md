# Findings

## High Risk

### Incorrect reward calculation.

**Description**

Function _calculate() is supposed to collect the user's earned reward during each round with
its particular rate during the user's lock period. However, it will return interest only for the last
round, since variable interest is assigned with new value each iteration of the cycle. Thus, the
user loses a significant part of his reward.

**Recommendation**:

Consider using a temporary variable for the result of calculation in lines 485 and 498 and add
this variable to amount and interest. Thus, interest will contain all the reward, user is
supposed to collect. Example of fix:

**From the Client**:

Since the interests generated for the previous periods are added to the amount, we return the
interest earned on the updated amount each period. It all depends on the incremental gap
between these interest rates that the contract is updated to. So we can assure that these
interest rate changes will be minimum and well be calculated before updating.

**Post Audit**:

Client assured that he is aware of this logic. Client also assured that all the updates, connected
with interest rate changes will be well calculated before changing.

## Medium Risk

### Misunderstanding number used.

**Description**

Line 618. lockDuration is multiplied by 1200, which can lead to misunderstanding of the code.
lockDuration is set in function resetAndsetStartEndBlock, line 305, without specifying which
time interval it represents.

**Recommendation**:

Use storage constant instead of 1200. Also specify, which time interval does lockDuration
represent(i.g. 1 day, 1 hour).

### Code is not corresponding comments.

**Description**

In Line 264 is said, that lockduration_ variable is passed as amounts of days and assigned to
storage variable lockDuration, however in lines 357, 375 lockDuration is multiplied by 3600(1
hour), which means that lockDuration represents amounts of hours.

**Recommendation**:

Either correct the comments in case lockduration_ represents amount of hours, or change
3600 to 1 days.


## Low Risk

### Old Solidity version

**Description**

Contracts are using Solidity 0.5.16 version. It is recommended to use the actual version which
is 0.8.9.

**Recommendation**:

Update contracts’ version.

### Unnecessary usage of SafeMath library.

**Description**

Starting from Solidity version 0.8.0 there is no need of using SafeMath, since Solidity has a
built- in check for overflow/underflow.

**Recommendation**:

Replace SafeMath function with Solidity operators(+, -, *, /).

### Useless modifier

**Description**

Locking.sol, Line 527 + LockedFarming.sol, Line 729. _realAddress modifier.
Modifier checks that the sender is not a zero address. Since it is impossible to send a
transaction from zero address, this modifier will never revert a transaction.

**Recommendation**:

Remove modifier.

### Useless modifier.

**Description**

Line 532, _hasAllowance modifier.
There is no need to check the contract's allowance, since safeTransfer always reverts in case
allowance is not enough.

**Recommendation**:

Remove modifier.

### Confusing code.

**Description**

In line 486, 10000 is used as a constant in the expression, which can lead to misunderstanding
the code.

**Recommendation**:

Use storage constant instead.

### Useless modifier.

**Description**

Line 732. Modifier _hasAllowance. This modifier check contract’s allowance and that passed
token address is equal to storage variables tokenAddress or rewardTokenAddress, however
there is no need to check kthe contract's allowance, since safeTransfer always reverts in case
allowance is not enough. Also, in every call of this modifier, the storage variables
tokenAddress and rewardTokenAddress are passed, which means that this check will never
revert.

**Recommendation**:

Remove modifier.


## Informational

### Function does not return values in every scenario.

**Description**

Locking.sol, Line 307 + LockedFarming.sol, Line 436. Function userDeposits returns values
only in case ‘from’ variable has stakes. This can lead to misunderstandings.

**Recommendation**:

Return zeroes in case the user doesn’t have any stakes

### Repeated code.

**Description**

Lines 394-399, 428-433. Code contains duplicate logic.

**Recommendation**:

Move duplicate code to modifier and use it instead.

### Unreachable code and unnecessary return of bool value.

**Description**

Function addReward, Line 294 contains return statement, which is never reached, since
function _payMe() always either returns true or reverts. Also, there is no need for the function
addReward to return bool, since this function can return only true.

**Recommendation**:

remove returns(bool) and return statements in function. Also remove the if statement on line
293 and just call function _payMe instead.

### Unnecessary reading from storage.

**Description**

Function _calculate(), lines 470-472, 477.
Function _stake(), lines 365, 368, 370.
Function withdraw(), lines 396, 399.
Function _withdraw(), lines 404, 405, 406.
Multiple reads of values from mapping deposits.

**Recommendation**:

consider creating a memory pointer to struct Deposits in every function and use it instead in
order to reduce gas spendings.

### Unnecessary require statement and return of bool value.

**Description**

Line 350, Function _stake() contains unnecessary require statement, since _payMe() always
either returns true or reverts. Also, there is no need in returning bool in function _stake and
stake(), since they can only return true

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary ‘require’ statement and return of bool value.

### ‘Require’ statement never reverts.

**Description**

Line 399, function withdraw(). require(!deposits[msg.sender].paid, "Already paid out") never
reverts, since it is cut off by 2 previous ‘require’ statements. This happens, because user is
unable to have a stake, which is not paid.

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary ‘if’ and ‘require’ statement.

### Unnecessary require statement and return of bool value.

**Description**

Line 416, function _withdraw(). This statement will never fail, since _payDirect() can only either
return true or revert. Returning of bool in function _withdraw() and withdraw() is unnecessary
since they can only return true.
Line 446, function _emergencyWithdraw(). This ‘require’ also never reverts. Functions
_emergencyWithdraw() and emergencyWithdraw() can only return true.

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary ‘if’ and ‘require’ statements and return of bool value.

### Unnecessary returning of bool.

**Description**

Functions _payMe(), _payTo(), _payDirect() don’t need to return bool, since they can only either
return true or revert.

**Recommendation**:

Remove returning of bool.

### Repeated code.

**Description**


Function _stake contains repeated code in if else statement. Lines 398, 399, 402, 403 and lines
429-432 repeat in ‘if’ block and ‘else’ block.

**Recommendation**:

Move repeated code aside from if else statement.

### Commented code.

**Description**

Lines 257-261, 275.

**Recommendation**:

Remove commented code.

### Repeatable code

**Description**

Lines 493, 522, 546. "require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");"

**Recommendation**:

Replace repeatable code with modifier.

### Unreachable code.

**Description**

The following code cannot be reached:
Lines: 260, 395, 649; 300; 377; 380; 455, 539, 599; 623; 629.
_payMe(), addReward(), _renew(), _claimRewards(), _payDirect(), claimRewards(),
claimOldRewards() functions always return "true" or revert, "false" will not be returned.
Lines: 688, 703.
In the code, the _payDirect() function and _hasAllowance() modifier are called with an explicitly
specified addresses. There are no third-party addresses.
Line 245.
Before the setStartEnd() function, the addReward() function is executed, where on line 258 the
value of the totalReward variable is assigned, and the _rewardAmount variable is greater than
zero.
Line 434.
If the user has staked and the deposit period is equal to the current period (renewed), then
the user cannot have a zero deposit amount.
Line 556.
This check already exists in the fetchUserShare() function on line 545, and the _calculate()
function is called only in the calculate() function, so the check is not reached in any case.
