# Findings


## High Risk

### Revert during price deduction

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol:
dutchAuctionForPresale(), dutchAuctionForPublicMint() Auction length is limited because of
the expression “uint256 price = startingPrice - priceDeduction”
priceDeduction increases with time, thus it will reach the point when it becomes higher than
the price and the contract will revert because of the underflow.

**Recommendation**:

Add conditions to resolve the edge case or set the max for the priceDeduction so it will not
overflow the price.

## Medium Risk

### State variable `saleOpen` is misleading as it used to indicate the start of auction.

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, saleOpen

**Recommendation**:

Rename to reflect use of state variable.

### State variables saleOpen & presaleOpen of Smart Contract CryptoBearWatchClub are allocated to regulate current state of contract.

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, saleOpen & presaleOpen

**Recommendation**:

use one state variable to indicate current phase, e.g. state variable with data type enum with
values (PRIVATE_SALE, PRESALE, AUCTION).

### SRP. Method `mint` of Smart contract CryptoBearWatchClub has misleading name as it used for running auction sale and not just mint.
**Recommendation**:
Split mint by Smart contract owner functionality and auction sale to two diffrent methods.

### DRY. Check for not exceeding total supply of minted NFT tokens is duplicated over methods privateSaleMint, presaleMint, mint. CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, privateSaleMint, presaleMint, mint

**Recommendation**:
Move check to modifier and use it in that methods.

### Presale round does not return ETH

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, presaleMint()
presaleMint() function does not return excess ETH amount like the mint() function does. Thus
ETH may be left stuck on the contract.

**Recommendation**:

Verify the presaleMint() should not return excess ETH or correct the behavior.

### Smart contract owner is able to mint arbitrary number of NFT tokens.

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, reserveBears

**Recommendation**:

Limit ability of Smart contract owner to mint tokens.


### Smart contract owner is able to change phase of sale anytime.

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, setSaleStatus

**Recommendation**:

Restrict Smart contract owner to go over different sale phases.

## Low Risk

### Shadow naming

**Description**

CryptoBearWathcClub.sol, walletOfOwner()
Parameter “_owner” shadows storage variable.

**Recommendation**:

Consider renaming.

## Informational

### Meaningless override

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol, safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)
Function has the same code as the parent ERC721 contract, thus its override is meaningless. It
is enough to override the safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes).

**Recommendation**:

Remove unnecessary override.

### Solidity version should be updated

**Description**

Best practices for Solidity development and auditors standard checklist requires strict and
explicit usage of the latest stable version of Solidity, which is 0.8.11 at the moment.

**Recommendation**:

Consider updating to “pragma solidity 0.8.11;”.

### Variables can be changed to constants

**Description**

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol:
priceDeductionPercentage, startingPrice
Variables can be changed to public constants, since they are not changed throughout the
code.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of the public constants.

### SRP (Single-responsibility principle) . Smart contract CryptoBearWatchClub contains sale & auction logic that is use only during sale.

CryptoBearWatchClub.sol

**Recommendation**:

It is good practice to isolate sales & auction logic outside of Tokens Smart contracts as they
can be fixed, redeployed and destroyed after the sale period to free used space.

### Public methods are partially covered with Natspec annotations. (Unresolved)

**Recommendation**:

Cover all public methods with Natspec annotations.

### Repository does not contain dependency management of Smart contracts.
**Recommendation**:
initialize NPM project and define dependency to
Openzeppelin smart contracts package.

### Repository does not contain Ethereum development environmentconfiguration.
**Recommendation**:
use Truffle or Hardhat toolkits for automating of running tests, deployments and migrations.
