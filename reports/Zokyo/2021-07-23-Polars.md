# Findings

## Medium Risk

### **Pool may not be able to withdraw bwTokens**

**Description**

In the `SecondaryCollateralizationBWT.sol` file, there is a delegate function that moves `bw` and
collateral tokens. But black and white tokens are left in the first pool.
So, in the first pool, function `withdraw` will revert due to missing `_bwTokens`, in the second pool due
to `_blackTokens` or `_whiteTokens`.

Additional note: this function doesn’t seem to be used at all.

**Recommendation**:

If this is expected behavior - add a comment with a description. If not, there are several
possible solutions, depending on requirements, for example:
- Don’t allow delegation if the balance of white or black token > 0.
- Keep the required amount of `bwTokens` to burn all black/white tokens.
- Check if `newCollateralization` supports black/white tokens; if so, move them along
  with other tokens.
- Remove this function.

## Low Risk

### **Misleading event**

**Description**

In `SecondaryPoolBWT.sol` file, there are two misleading events:
```solidity
emit BlackPriceCase1(eend.whitePrice); // line 429
emit WhitePriceCase1(eend.blackPrice); // line 470
```

**Recommendation**:

Depending on requirements, switch tokens or events. For example, in case of tokens: set black on
line 429 and white on line 470.

### **Misleading error message [1]**

**Description**

In `SecondaryCollateralizationBWT.sol` file, in the constructor, there is a require statement:
```solidity
require (bwtAddress != address(0), "WHITE TOKEN ADDRESS SHOULD NOT BE NULL");
```

**Recommendation**:

Replace **"WHITE TOKEN"** with **"BWT TOKEN"**.




### **Potentially misleading event**

**Description**

In `SecondaryCollateralizationBWT.sol` file, there are 2 functions (`withdrawCollateral` and
`withdraw`). Despite different tokens, they share the same `WithdrawLiquidity` event.

**Recommendation**:

There are several possible solutions, for example:
- Add an additional event.
- Add a variable to highlight the token in the current event.
- Remove the event in `withdrawCollateral`.

### **Misleading error message [2]**

**Description**

In `SecondaryCollateralizationBWT.sol`, there is a modifier:
```solidity
modifier onlyGovernance () {
    require (_governanceAddress == msg.sender, "Caller should be pool");
    _;
}
```

**Recommendation**:

Replace **"should be pool"** with **"should be governance"**.

## Informational

### **Unexpected words order**

**Description**

In `SecondaryPoolBWT.sol` file, there are 11 occurrences of the `...should be not...` expression,
example: `"WHITE token address should be not null"`.

The correct word order is `...should not be...`.

**Recommendation**:

Replace **"...should be not null"** with **"...should not be null"** (and apply the same fix for 10 other variations of this message).

### **Misleading comment**

**Description**

In `SecondaryPoolBWT.sol` file, there is a misleading comment:
```solidity
// liquidity provider fee: initial 40% of total FEE
uint256 public _lpFee = 0.5 * 1e18;
// team fee: initial – 20% of total FEE
uint256 public _controllerFee = 0.1 * 1e18;
```

**Recommendation**:

Replace **40%** with **50%** and **20%** with **10%**.
