# Findings


## High Risk

### Incorrect total in case of whitelist re-setting

**Description**

PrivateVesting.sol, setWhitelist(), line 95
In case if whitelist should be re set (there are some deposits set), the _totalDeposit will be
calculated incorrectly. In case if the user has a deposit (line 94), its value is subtracted from the
_totalDeposit, but is never increased by _tokenAmount[] for this user. In spite of the
deposit[user] value is actually changed to _tokenAmount[index]. Thus, the token amount is
not taken into the consideration for that user.

**Recommendation**:

else statement is unneeded. Subtract deposit[user] value within the if statement and
always perform the addition of _tokenAmount[index] value.

## Medium Risk

### No deposit token validation

**Description**

Vesting.sol
Since the contract does not have any validation for deposit tokens, consider the usage of
SafeERC20 library for transfers of deposit token and ReentrancyGuard in order to prevent
reentrancy+fake token attack combination.
Potentially affected methods:
Vesting.withdrawFunds()
Vesting.deposite()

**Recommendation**:

Use SafeERC20 library for deposit token transfer() and transferFrom()
move storage changes before the transfer/transferFrom operation
use ReentrancyGuard for affected methods

## Low Risk

### No checks against accuracy

**Description**

Both PrivateVesting and Vesting contracts has no checks if initial percentage for unlock is not
greater than the desired accuracy (see _initialPercentage variable).

**Recommendation**:

Add necessary checks.

### Gas consuming optimization

**Description**

Since 0.8.x versions of Solidity have built in support of overflow and underflow prevention
mechanisms, the SafeMath library user may be omitted throughout the contracts.

**Recommendation**:

Omit SafeMath library usage.

## Informational

### Use constant for the accuracy

**Description**

PrivateVesting.sol, line 150, _calculateUnlock()
Vesting.sol, line 253, _calculateUnlock()
Consider moving the accuracy value to the constant. Such an approach will omit magic
number usage and increase the quality of the code.

**Recommendation**:

Consider constant usage.

### Set Solidity version fixed

**Description**

Contracts have ^0.8.0 Solidity version and ^4.1.0 OpenZeppelin version. Technically such a
setup should pick the highest available version. Nevertheless, the best practice is to have a
fixed version of Solidity and OZ library (like 0.8.4 or the latest one 0.8.6).

**Recommendation**:

Use a fixed version of the Solidity and OZ library.
