# Findings

## High Risk

### Absent framework.

**Description**

No framework (Truffle or Brownie) and additional migrations/scripts - it affects further
development and deployment processes.

**Recommendation**:

Provide the initial framework for the contracts set


### No tests.

**Description**

Absent test coverage. Formal logic is not checked, so currently it cannot guarantee the
correctness of contracts functionality.

**Recommendation**:

Provide the initial test coverage for the formal logic of the contracts

## Medium Risk

### transfer() instead of call()

**Description**

EthDexManager.sol, line 210
transfer() for Eth is considered as unsafe (because of Istanbul Ethereum update) and should
be replaced with call(). Especially because of missing restrictions to non-contract accounts.

**Recommendation**:

Change transfer() to call().


### Use safeTransfer() and safeTransferFrom().

**Description**

BaseDexManager.sol - line 96
BaseDexManager.sol - line 150
EthDexManager.sol - line 143
BaseDexManager.sol - line 130
EthDexManager.sol - line 120

**Recommendation**:

Use the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom from SafeERC20 library.


## Low Risk

### Extra code.

**Description**

RuleEngine.sol, Imports Misc library with today() function which is repeated in the code
(RuleEngine.sol, line 65)

**Recommendation**:
Remove extra code.


### No zero address check

**Description**

RuleEngine.sol, line 37 - no check for zero addresses. It is mentioned as an issue, because
there is no visible deployment script, so there is a place for mistakes. It is also important, since
there is no interface for StakingContract changing.

**Recommendation**:

Use for example Misc.zeroOrContract().

### Incorrect math.

**Description**

RuleEngine.sol, line 95. The function availableTrades() returns uint. Also, solc 0.8 has included
safe math, so, return operation with unappropriate result of the subtraction will be reverted.
Though, per the documentation for the function, it should return the amount of trades
available. But the contract contains the functionality for manipulation with the stakes per
trade calculation, so we can easily get the underflow (which will cause the revert).

**Recommendation**:

So the recommendation is to fix the statement and add “return 0” in case if
“tradesBasedOnStake” will become less than number of trades per day.


## Informational

### Extra contract.

**Description**

DexManager has no functional role. It just has the same functionality as the EthDexManager,
but adds more weight to the contract, more gas fees for initializing and can be completely
replaced with the EthDexManager.

**Recommendation**:

Extra contract which can be reduced.

### Max allowance instead of required.

**Description**

BaseDexManager.sol, line 135
EthDexManager.sol, line 125
The contract provides the approval for the max amount instead of the required one. It is not
safe from the funds flow point of view and creates a possibility to exploit the reentrancy in not
safe calls from the contract. The issue is marked as low, because it does not affect the user,
but only the manager contract and is covered in existing methods by appropriate checks.

**Recommendation**:

Provide approve for the amount needed instead of max.
