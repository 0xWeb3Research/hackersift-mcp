# Findings

## High Risk

### Contract ERC20 lets anyone to mint tokens.

**Recommendation**:
Minting tokens should be limited to contracts with that right.

### Contract Vesting does not guarantee existence of tokens to be released on vesting schedule.

Recommendation:
Vesting contract has to transfer tokens to itself to make vesting schedule active.

### Smart contracts are not pointing to specific solidity compiler version.

**Recommendation**:

Point to specific solidity compiler version.

## Low Risk

### Contract Vesting has method name with typo `revocked`.

**Recommendation**:
Rename method name to `revoked`.

## Informational

### DRY, Smart contract ERC20 is based on openzeppelin library.

**Recommendation**:

Add openzeppelin to dependencies and inherit openzeppelin ERC20 & ERC20Burnable
contracts implementation.

### Smart contract Vesting is not covered by NatSpec annotations.
**Recommendation**:
Cover by NatSpec all public Contract methods.
