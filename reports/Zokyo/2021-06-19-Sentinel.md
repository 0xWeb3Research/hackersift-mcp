# Findings

## Low Risk

### In vpn module, late assigning used, instead of constructor

**Description**

Cosmos-sdk best practices are trying to avoid using late assignment, and are more prone
towards constructor initialization.
Recommendation:
Replace late assignments of keepers, passing them to the constructor directly.

### Unhandled errors in EmitTypedEvent

**Description**

Unhandled errors in code are ignored, which may lead to unexpected errors of events
emitting, which are not registered or logged in some way.

**Recommendation**:

Either ignore errors explicitly or handle them.

## Informational

### Messages unit-test coverage

**Description**

For best cosmos-sdk security practices, each message in msg_server.go should be covered
with tests.

**Recommendation**:

Write tests for each msg_server.go file.

### Empty ABCI in swap module

**Description**

File x/swap/abci.go - has no source code.

**Recommendation**:

Remove empty file.
