# Findings

## High Risk

### Stars.sol wrong constructor arguments

**Description**

"_initialHolders" variable was listed twice.


**Recommendation**:

change variables to match constructorâ€™s expectation:

- address _admin;
- address[] memory _initialHolders;
- uint256[] memory _premintedAmounts;
- uint256 _inflationBasisPoint;
- uint256 _mintLockPeriodSecs.

**Re-audit**:
Mogul development team has fixed the issue. Zokyo team has reviewed the issue mentioned
above and confirms that it was successfully resolved.

### Stars.sol no SafeMath applied

**Description**

There are several calculations in the code that potentially could lead to under or overflows.

**Examples**:

- remainingYearlyInflationAmt -= amount; [line 77]
- nextMintStartTime += mintLockPeriodSecs; [line 97]
- remainingYearlyInflationAmt = (totalSupplyThisYear * _inflationBasisPoint) / 10000; [line 50-52]
- remainingYearlyInflationAmt = (totalSupplyThisYear * inflationBasisPoint) / 10000; [line 99-101]

**Recommendation**:

Example can be seen in AccessPassSale.sol contract:
- import "@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol"; [line 4]
- using SafeMath for uint256; [line 9]
- newAmount.sub(currAmount) [line 134]
