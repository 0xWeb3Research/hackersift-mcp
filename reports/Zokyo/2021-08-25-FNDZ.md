# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Update Solidity version

**Description**

The project utilises Solidity 0.5.17 and 0.4.23 versions which are marked as outdated. The
standard auditorâ€™s checklist states for the usage of the latest version of the Solidity - 0.6.12,
0.7.6 or 0.8.6. Thus the issue is marked as Medium.

**Recommendation**:

Use the latest stable release of Solidity. Also, use the single Solidity version within the
contracts set.

## Low Risk

### Low level reentrancy

**Description**

Vesting.sol, line 559, removeTokenGrant()
External call to the token is performed before the storage clean up. The best practices is to
prepare all storage operations before the transfer is performed. Thus, in case of further
development and change of the Token contract, the Vesting contract can be drained.

**Recommendation**:

Move all storage operations before the token transfer.

### Interfaces instead of contracts

**Description**

Vesting.sol: DSAuthority, DSAuthEvents, ERC20Events, ERC20, ERC20Extended are defined as
contracts. Though they do not have functionality, so it is recommended to define them as
interfaces. Also, for ERC20 functionality, it is recommended to use OpenZeppelin.

**Recommendation**:

Use the latest stable release of Solidity. Also, use the single Solidity version within the
contracts set.

### Zero address check

**Description**

contracts/FNDZToken.sol#355, constructor()
Check for zero address is missing. Since there is no way to retrieve tokens from the zero
address consider additional check. Thus the issue is marked as low.
The same issue refers to Vesting contract (Vesting.sol, line 465) - recipient is not checked
against zero address.

**Recommendation**:

Add check for the zero address.

### Outdated codebase, consider OZ approach

**Description**

Contract FNDZToken.sol is compatible with ERC20 (BEP20) standard with no additional
functionality except tokens initial mint. Consider usage of standard OpenZeppelin token
implementation. Inherit standard functionality with only constructor changed - such an
approach increases the code readability and overall quality and decreases the size of the
codebase.
The same functionality (especially for mint and burn functionality) should be considered to
implement for the Token and DSTokenBase contracts from Vesting.sol.
Also consider usage of standard Ownable (for Vesting and Token contracts) and Pausable (for
the token contract) functionality.

**Recommendation**:

Consider usage of the standard contract to omit possible mistakes in further development
and to increase the code quality.

## Informational

### Gas optimization

**Description**

contracts/Vesting.sol#556, removeTokenGrant()
daysVested variable may be omitted, since it is not used.

Recommendation:

Remove extra variable.

### Incorrect info stored

**Description**

contracts/Vesting.sol#610, calculateGrantClaim()
In case if the user has claimed tokens at least once before the vesting end, the incorrect
number will be stored in case if the last claim will be performed after the vesting end. The
function calculateGranClaim() returns the number of days of vesting without the consideration
of tokenGrant.daysClaimed. Though, since this edge case does not influence the main flow,
but only the stored info after the vesting end, the issue is marked as info.

**Recommendation**:

correct the calculation for the edge case.
